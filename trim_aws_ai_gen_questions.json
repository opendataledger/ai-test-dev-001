For example, you can restrict access to specific AWS Regions, or prevent your operators from deleting common resources, such as an IAM role used for your central security team.Common anti-patterns:Running workloads in your Organizational administrator account.Running production and non-production workloads in the same account.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumAs you grow and manage additional workloads in AWS, you should separate these workloads using accounts and manage those accounts using AWS Organizations. We recommend that you establish common permission guardrails that restrict access to all identities in your organization. For example, you can restrict access to specific AWS Regions, or prevent your team from deleting common resources, such as an IAM role used by your central security team.You can get started by implementing example service control policies, such as preventing users from disabling key services. SCPs use the IAM policy language and enable you to establish controls that all IAM principals (users and roles) adhere to. You can restrict access to specific service actions, resources and based on specific condition to meet the access control needs of your organization. If necessary, you can define exceptions to your guardrails. For example, you can restrict service actions for all IAM entities in the account except for a specific administrator role.We recommend you avoid running workloads in your management account. The management account should be used to govern and deploy security guardrails that will affect member accounts. Some AWS services support the use of a delegated administrator account. When available, you should use this delegated account instead of the management account. You should strongly limit access to the Organizational administrator account.Using a multi-account strategy allows you to have greater flexibility in applying guardrails to your workloads. The AWS Security Reference Architecture gives prescriptive guidance on how to design your account structure. AWS services such as AWS Control Tower provide capabilities to centrally manage both preventative and detective controls across your organization. Define a clear purpose for each account or OU within your organization and limit controls in line with that purpose.Related documents:AWS OrganizationsService control policies (SCPs)Get more out of service control policies in a multi-account environmentAWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA)Related videos:Enforce Preventive Guardrails using Service Control PoliciesBuilding governance at scale with AWS Control TowerAWS Identity and Access Management deep dive\n* Govern the consumption of shared resources across accounts or within your AWS Organizations. Monitor shared resources and review shared resource access.Common anti-patterns:Using the default IAM trust policy when granting third party cross-account access.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAs you manage your workloads using multiple AWS accounts, you may need to share resources between accounts. This will very often be cross-account sharing within an AWS Organizations. Several AWS services, such as AWS Security Hub, Amazon GuardDuty, and AWS Backup have cross-account features integrated with Organizations. You can use AWS Resource Access Manager to share other common resources, such as VPC Subnets or Transit Gateway attachments, AWS Network Firewall, or Amazon SageMaker pipelines. If you want to ensure that your account only shares resources within your Organizations, we recommend using Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent access to external principals.When sharing resources, you should put measures in place to protect against unintended access. We recommend combining identity-based controls and network controls to create a data perimeter for your organization. These controls should place strict limits on what resources can be shared and prevent sharing or exposing resources that should not be allowed. For example, as a part of your data perimeter you could use VPC endpoint policies and the aws:PrincipalOrgId condition to ensure the identities accessing your Amazon S3 buckets belong to your organization.In some cases, you may want to allow share resources outside of your Organizations or grant third parties access to your account. For example, a partner may provide a monitoring solution that needs to access resources within your account. In those cases, you should create an IAM cross-account role with only the privileges needed by the third party. You should also craft a trust policy using the external ID condition. When using an external ID, you should generate a unique ID for each third party. The unique ID should not be supplied by or controlled by the third party. If the third party no longer needs access to your environment, you should remove the role. You should also avoid providing long-term IAM credentials to a third-party in all cases. Maintain awareness of other AWS services which natively support sharing. For example, the AWS Well-Architected Tool allows sharing a workload with other AWS accounts.When using service such as Amazon S3, it is recommended to disable ACLs for your Amazon S3 bucket and use IAM policies to define access control. For restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin from Amazon CloudFront, migrate from origin access identity (OAI) to origin access control (OAC) which supports additional features including server-side encryption with AWS KMS.Related documents:Bucket owner granting cross-account permission to objects it does not ownHow to use Trust Policies with IAMBuilding Data Perimeter on AWSHow to use an external ID when granting a third party access to your AWS resourcesRelated videos:Granular Access with AWS Resource Access ManagerSecuring your data perimeter with VPC endpointsEstablishing a data perimeter on AWS\n* Integrate access controls with operator and application lifecycle and your centralized federation provider. For example, remove a user\u2019s access when they leave the organization or change roles.As you manage workloads using separate accounts, there will be cases where you need to share resources between those accounts. We recommend that you share resources using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This service enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources within your AWS Organizations and Organizational Units. Using AWS RAM, access to shared resources is automatically granted or revoked as accounts are moved in and out of the Organization or Organization Unit with which they are shared. This helps ensure that resources are only shared with the accounts that you intend.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowImplement a user access lifecycle policy for new users joining, job function changes, and users leaving so that only current users have access.Related documents:Attribute-based access control (ABAC)Grant least privilegeIAM Access AnalyzerRemove unnecessary credentialsWorking with PoliciesRelated videos:Become an IAM Policy Master in 60 Minutes or LessSeparation of Duties, Least Privilege, Delegation, and CI/CD\n\nKnowledge Area: Access controls and management across multiple accounts\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What action should an organization take to ensure access to shared resources is only granted to the accounts that are intended?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Use the default IAM trust policy when granting third-party cross-account access\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Using the default IAM trust policy when granting third-party cross-account access is an anti-pattern and should be avoided.

This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes.For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider\u2014 whether hosted by you in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner\u2014that is compatible with the SAML 2.0 protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website.For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source of truth, and information can be synchronized using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both.IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege. Alternatively, you can choose to Connect to Your External Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, or Connect to Your Microsoft AD Directory using AWS Directory Service. Once configured, you can sign into the AWS Management Console, or the AWS mobile app, by authenticating through your central identity provider.For managing end-users or consumers of your workloads, such as a mobile app, you can use Amazon Cognito. It provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Google.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighCentralize administrative access: Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity provider entity to establish a trusted relationship between your AWS account and your identity provider (IdP). IAM supports IdPs that are compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0).Identity Providers and FederationCentralize application access: Consider Amazon Cognito for centralizing application access. It lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0.Remove old IAM users and groups: After you start using an identity provider (IdP), remove IAM users and groups that are no longer required.Finding unused credentialsDeleting an IAM groupRelated documents:IAM Best PracticesSecurity Partner Solutions: Access and Access ControlTemporary Security CredentialsThe AWS Account Root UserRelated videos:Best Practices for Managing, Retrieving, and Rotating Secrets at ScaleManaging user permissions at scale with AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)Mastering identity at every layer of the cake\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS federated access and identity services (for example, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM], AWS Single Sign-On [AWS SSO])\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best practice for managing user identities and access in the given scenario?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"Use IAM Identity Center to configure the identity source and set up federation with individual AWS accounts.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations and enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Set up a web-based single sign-on for the users to access the AWS Management Console.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Web-based single sign-on is supported, but it is not the best practice for managing user identities and access in the given scenario.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use Amazon Cognito for end-user or consumer management.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon Cognito is useful for managing end-users or consumers of your workloads, such as a mobile app. However, it is not the best practice for managing user identities and access in the given scenario.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Set up an identity provider that enables centralized management of identities.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Relying on an identity provider that enables you to manage identities in a centralized place is the best practice for managing user identities and access in the given scenario.

Use AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as AWS Outposts, AWS Local Zones, and AWS Wavelength, to reduce network latency or improve throughput.The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones. A Region is a physical location in the world having multiple Availability Zones.Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data centerChoose the appropriate Region or Regions for your deployment based on the following key elements:Where your users are located: Choosing a Region close to your workload\u2019s users ensures lower latency when they use the workload.Where your data is located: For data-heavy applications, the major bottleneck in latency is data transfer. Application code should execute as close to the data as possible.Other constraints: Consider constraints such as security and compliance.Amazon EC2 provides placement groups for networking. A placement group is a logical grouping of instances to decrease latency or increase reliability. Using placement groups with supported instance types and an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) enables workloads to participate in a low-latency, 25 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for workloads that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. Using placement groups has the benefit of lowering jitter in network communications.Latency-sensitive services are delivered at the edge using a global network of edge locations. These edge locations commonly provide services such as content delivery network (CDN) and domain name system (DNS). By having these services at the edge, workloads can respond with low latency to requests for content or DNS resolution. These services also provide geographic services such as geo targeting of content (providing different content based on the end users\u2019 location), or latency-based routing to direct end users to the nearest Region (minimum latency).Amazon CloudFront is a global CDN that can be used to accelerate both static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content such as APIs or web applications. It relies on a global network of edge locations that will cache the content and provide high-performance network connectivity to your users. CloudFront also accelerates many other features such as content uploading and dynamic applications, making it a performance addition to all applications serving traffic over the internet. Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that will let you run code closer to users of your workload, which improves performance and reduces latency.Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service. It\u2019s designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to internet applications by translating names, like www.example.com, into numeric IP addresses, like 192.168.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6.AWS Outposts is designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency requirements, where you want that workload to run seamlessly with the rest of your other workloads in AWS. AWS Outposts are fully managed and configurable compute and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware that allow you to run compute and storage on-premises, while seamlessly connecting to the broad array of AWS services in in the cloud.AWS Local Zones is designed to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, like video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications. Local Zones allow you to gain all the benefits of having compute and storage resources closer to end-users.AWS Wavelength is designed to deliver ultra-low latency applications to 5G devices by extending AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to 5G networks. Wavelength embeds storage and compute inside telco providers 5G networks to help your 5G workload if it requires single-digit millisecond latency, such as IoT devices, game streaming, autonomous vehicles, and live media production.Use edge services to reduce latency and to enable content caching. Ensure that you have configured cache control correctly for both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS to gain the most benefit from these approaches.Common anti-patterns:You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.You chose the closest region to your location but not to the workload end user.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You must ensure that your network is available wherever you want to reach customers. Using the AWS private global network ensures that your customers get the lowest latency experience by deploying workloads into the locations nearest them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumReduce latency by selecting the correct locations: Identify where your users and data are located. Take advantage of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations to reduce latency.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best way to reduce network latency and improve throughput with AWS global infrastructure?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Deploy workloads into the closest AWS region to your location.\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is not the best way as it does not take into account where the user is located, which is a key factor in reducing network latency.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Deploy workloads into the AWS region closest to the user.\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"This is the best way as it takes into account where the user is located, which is a key factor in reducing network latency.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use AWS Outposts to run workloads on-premises.\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is not the best way as it is not designed to reduce network latency.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use AWS Route 53 to route end users to internet applications.\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is not the best way as it is not designed to reduce network latency.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('PERF05-BP06 Choose your workload\u2019s location based on network requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_network_location.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A media company wants to store large amounts of data that will be used for thier applications", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design secure access to AWS resources", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "AWS security best practices (for example, the principle of least privilege)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Rely on groups and identity attributes to dynamically set permissions at scale, rather than defining permissions for individual users. For example, you can allow a group of developers access to manage only resources for their project. This way, when a developer is removed from the group, access for the developer is revoked everywhere that group was used for access control, without requiring any changes to the access policies.Common anti-patterns:Defaulting to granting users administrator permissions.Using the root account for day-to-day activities.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEstablishing a principle of least privilege ensures that identities are only permitted to perform the most minimal set of functions necessary to fulfill a specific task, while balancing usability and efficiency. Operating on this principle limits unintended access and helps ensure that you can audit who has access to which resources. In AWS, identities have no permissions by default except for the root user. The credentials for the root user should be tightly controlled and only be used for a few specific tasks.You use policies to explicitly grant permissions attached to IAM or resource entities, such as an IAM role used by federated identities or machines, or resources (for example, S3 buckets). When you create and attach a policy, you can specify the service actions, resources, and conditions that must be true for AWS to allow access. AWS supports a variety of conditions to help you scope down access. For example, using the PrincipalOrgIDcondition key, the identifier of the AWS Organizations is verified so access can be granted within your AWS Organization.You can also control requests that AWS services make on your behalf, such as AWS CloudFormation creating an AWS Lambda function by using the CalledVia condition key. You should layer different policy types to effectively limit the overall permissions within an account. For example, you can allow your application teams to create their own IAM policies, but use a Permission Boundary to limit the maximum permissions they can grant.There are several AWS capabilities to help you scale permission management and adhere to the principle of least privilege. Attribute Based Access control allows you to limit permissions based on the tag of a resource, for making authorization decisions based on the tags applied to the resource and the calling IAM principal. This enables you to combine your tagging and permissions policy to achieve fine-grained resource access without needing many custom policies.Another way to accelerate creating a least privilege policy, is to base your policy on CloudTrail permissions after an activity runs. AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (IAM Access Analyzer) can automatically generate an IAM policy based on activity. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer at the Organization or individual account level to track the last accessed information for a particular policy.Establish a cadence of reviewing these details and removing unneeded permissions. You should establish permissions guardrails within your AWS Organization to control the maximum permissions within any member account. Services such as AWS Control Tower have prescriptive managed preventative controls and allow you to define your own controls.Related documents:Permissions boundaries for IAM entitiesTechniques for writing least privilege IAM policiesIAM Access Analyzer makes it easier to implement least privilege permissions by generating IAM policies based on access activityDelegate permission management to developers by using IAM permissions boundariesRefining Permissions using last accessed informationIAM policy types and when to use themTesting IAM policies with the IAM policy simulatorGuardrails in AWS Control TowerZero Trust architectures: An AWS perspectiveHow to implement the principle of least privilege with CloudFormation StackSetsRelated videos:Next-generation permissions managementZero Trust: An AWS perspectiveHow can I use permissions boundaries to limit IAM users and roles to prevent privilege escalation?Related examples:Lab: IAM permissions boundaries delegating role creation\n* There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:Implement a strong identity foundation: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.Enable traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system, application, and code).Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS security best practices (for example, the principle of least privilege)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What is the best practice for minimizing the risk of privilege escalation when managing IAM users and roles?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Grant users administrator permissions\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Defaulting to granting users administrator permissions is an anti-pattern and not best practice. \"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use the root account for day-to-day activities\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"The credentials for the root user should be tightly controlled and only be used for a few specific tasks. \"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Delegate permission management to developers by using IAM permissions boundaries\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Using IAM permissions boundaries, you can limit the maximum permissions that developers can grant.

You will want to control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.The AWS Shared Responsibility Model enables organizations that adopt the cloud to achieve their security and compliance goals. Because AWS physically secures the infrastructure that supports our cloud services, as an AWS customer you can focus on using services to accomplish your goals. The AWS Cloud also provides greater access to security data and an automated approach to responding to security events.\n* Share best practices across teams to increase awareness and maximize the benefits of development efforts.On AWS, application, compute, infrastructure, and operations can be defined and managed using code methodologies. This allows for easy release, sharing, and adoption.Many AWS services and resources are designed to be shared across accounts, enabling you to share created assets and learnings across your teams. For example, you can share CodeCommit repositories, Lambda functions, Amazon S3 buckets, and AMIs to specific accounts.When you publish new resources or updates, use Amazon SNS to provide cross account notifications. Subscribers can use Lambda to get new versions.If shared standards are enforced in your organization, it\u2019s critical that mechanisms exist to request additions, changes, and exceptions to standards in support of teams\u2019 activities. Without this option, standards become a constraint on innovation.Common anti-patterns:You have created your own user authentication mechanism, as have each of the other development teams in your organization. Your users have to maintain a separate set of credentials for each part of the system they want to access.You have created your own user authentication mechanism, as have each of the other development teams in your organization. Your organization is given a new compliance requirement that must be met. Every individual development team must now invest the resources to implement the new requirement.You have created your own screen layout, as have each of the other development teams in your organization. Your users are complaining about the difficulty of navigating the inconsistent interfaces.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Use shared standards to support the adoption of best practices and to maximizes the benefits of development efforts where standards satisfy requirements for multiple applications or organizations.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumShare design standards: Share existing best practices, design standards, checklists, operating procedures, and guidance and governance requirements across teams to reduce complexity and maximize the benefits from development efforts. Ensure that procedures exist to request changes, additions, and exceptions to design standards to support continual improvement and innovation. Ensure that teams are aware of published content so that they can take advantage of content, and limit rework and wasted effort.Delegating access to your AWS environmentShare an AWS CodeCommit repositoryEasy authorization of AWS Lambda functionsSharing an AMI with specific AWS accountsSpeed template sharing with an AWS CloudFormation designer URLUsing AWS Lambda with Amazon SNSRelated documents:Easy authorization of AWS Lambda functionsShare an AWS CodeCommit repositorySharing an AMI with specific AWS accountsSpeed template sharing with an AWS CloudFormation designer URLUsing AWS Lambda with Amazon SNSRelated videos:Delegating access to your AWS environment\n* Managed services shift responsibility for maintaining high-average utilization, and sustainability optimization of the deployed hardware to AWS.

Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) with software or hardware mechanisms to provide an additional layer of verification. For example, when using IAM Identity Center as the identity source, configure the \u201ccontext-aware\u201d or \u201calways-on\u201d setting for MFA, and allow users to enroll their own MFA devices to accelerate adoption.

For example, implement development, test, and production groups. This applies to AWS services and third-party solutions.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAfter you develop policies, you can create logical groups and roles of users within your organization. This allows you to assign permissions and control usage. Begin with high-level groupings of people. Typically this aligns with organizational units and job roles (for example, systems administrator in the IT Department, or financial controller). The groups join people that do similar tasks and need similar access. Roles define what a group must do. For example, a systems administrator in IT requires access to create all resources, but an analytics team member only needs to create analytics resources.Implementation stepsImplement groups: Using the groups of users defined in your organizational policies, implement the corresponding groups, if necessary. Refer to the security pillar for best practices on users, groups, and authentication.Implement roles and policies: Using the actions defined in your organizational policies, create the required roles and access policies. Refer to the security pillar for best practices on roles and policies.Related documents:AWS managed policies for job functionsAWS multiple account billing strategyControl access to AWS Regions using IAM policiesWell-Architected Security PillarRelated examples:Well-Architected Lab Basic Identity and Access\n* Each component or resource of your workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.Common anti-patterns:Hard-coding or storing secrets in your application.Granting custom permissions for each user.Using long-lived credentials.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEach component or resource of your workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.Regular access to AWS accounts within the organization should be provided using federated access or a centralized identity provider. You should also centralize your identity management and ensure that there is an established practice to integrate AWS access to your employee access lifecycle. For example, when an employee changes to a job role with a different access level, their group membership should also change to reflect their new access requirements.When defining access requirements for non-human identities, determine which applications and components need access and how permissions are granted. Using IAM roles built with the least privilege access model is a recommended approach. AWS Managed policies provide predefined IAM policies that cover most common use cases.AWS services, such as AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, can help decouple secrets from the application or workload securely in cases where it's not feasible to use IAM roles. In Secrets Manager, you can establish automatic rotation for your credentials. You can use Systems Manager to reference parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, configuration, and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.You can use AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere to obtain temporary security credentials in IAM for workloads that run outside of AWS. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and IAM roles that you use with AWS applications to access AWS resources.Where possible, prefer short-term temporary credentials over long-term static credentials. For scenarios in which you need IAM users with programmatic access and long-term credentials, use access key last used information to rotate and remove access keys.Related documents:Attribute-based access control (ABAC)AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)IAM Roles AnywhereAWS Managed policies for IAM Identity CenterAWS IAM policy conditionsIAM use casesRemove unnecessary credentialsWorking with PoliciesHow to control access to AWS resources based on AWS account, OU, or organizationIdentify, arrange, and manage secrets easily using enhanced search in AWS Secrets ManagerRelated videos:Become an IAM Policy Master in 60 Minutes or LessSeparation of Duties, Least Privilege, Delegation, and CI/CDStreamlining identity and access management for innovation\n\nKnowledge Area: Designing a flexible authorization model that includes IAM users, groups, roles, and policies\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best approach for the transportation company to use when granting access to AWS resources for their connected vehicles?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Granting custom permissions for each vehicle\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"This is not recommended since it would be time consuming and difficult to maintain.\"}, \n    {\"answer\": \"Using long-lived credentials\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"This is not recommended since it can increase the risk of unauthorized access.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Using IAM roles built with the least privilege access model\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"This is the best approach since it allows for secure and granular control of access.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Storing secrets in the application\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"This is not recommended since it is insecure and increases the risk of unauthorized access.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('COST02-BP04 Implement groups and roles - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_govern_usage_groups_roles.html')", "('SEC03-BP01 Define access requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_define.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to run a disaster recovery plan for their critical systems on AWS.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design secure access to AWS resources", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Designing a role-based access control strategy (for example, AWS Security Token Service [AWS STS], role switching, cross-account access)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

We recommend that you establish common permission guardrails that restrict access to all identities in your organization. For example, you can restrict access to specific AWS Regions, or prevent your team from deleting common resources, such as an IAM role used by your central security team.You can get started by implementing example service control policies, such as preventing users from disabling key services. SCPs use the IAM policy language and enable you to establish controls that all IAM principals (users and roles) adhere to. You can restrict access to specific service actions, resources and based on specific condition to meet the access control needs of your organization. If necessary, you can define exceptions to your guardrails. For example, you can restrict service actions for all IAM entities in the account except for a specific administrator role.We recommend you avoid running workloads in your management account. The management account should be used to govern and deploy security guardrails that will affect member accounts. Some AWS services support the use of a delegated administrator account. When available, you should use this delegated account instead of the management account. You should strongly limit access to the Organizational administrator account.Using a multi-account strategy allows you to have greater flexibility in applying guardrails to your workloads. The AWS Security Reference Architecture gives prescriptive guidance on how to design your account structure.

You can use AWS Resource Access Manager to share other common resources, such as VPC Subnets or Transit Gateway attachments, AWS Network Firewall, or Amazon SageMaker pipelines. If you want to ensure that your account only shares resources within your Organizations, we recommend using Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent access to external principals.When sharing resources, you should put measures in place to protect against unintended access. We recommend combining identity-based controls and network controls to create a data perimeter for your organization. These controls should place strict limits on what resources can be shared and prevent sharing or exposing resources that should not be allowed. For example, as a part of your data perimeter you could use VPC endpoint policies and the aws:PrincipalOrgId condition to ensure the identities accessing your Amazon S3 buckets belong to your organization.In some cases, you may want to allow share resources outside of your Organizations or grant third parties access to your account. For example, a partner may provide a monitoring solution that needs to access resources within your account. In those cases, you should create an IAM cross-account role with only the privileges needed by the third party. You should also craft a trust policy using the external ID condition. When using an external ID, you should generate a unique ID for each third party. The unique ID should not be supplied by or controlled by the third party. If the third party no longer needs access to your environment, you should remove the role. You should also avoid providing long-term IAM credentials to a third-party in all cases. Maintain awareness of other AWS services which natively support sharing. For example, the AWS Well-Architected Tool allows sharing a workload with other AWS accounts.When using service such as Amazon S3, it is recommended to disable ACLs for your Amazon S3 bucket and use IAM policies to define access control.

For workforce identities, use AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), or federation with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to access AWS accounts. For machine identities, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instances or AWS Lambda functions, require the use of IAM roles instead of IAM users with long-term access keys.For human identities using the AWS Management Console, require users to acquire temporary credentials and federate into AWS. You can do this using the AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) user portal. For users requiring CLI access, ensure that they use AWS CLI v2, which supports direct integration with IAM Identity Center. Users can create CLI profiles that are linked to IAM Identity Center accounts and roles. The CLI automatically retrieves AWS credentials from IAM Identity Center and refreshes them on your behalf. This eliminates the need to copy and paste temporary AWS credentials from the IAM Identity Center console. For SDK, users should rely on AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to assume roles to receive temporary credentials. In certain cases, temporary credentials might not be practical. You should be aware of the risks of storing access keys, rotate these often, and require multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a condition when possible. Use last accessed information to determine when to rotate or remove access keys.For cases where you need to grant consumers access to your AWS resources, use Amazon Cognito identity pools and assign them a set of temporary, limited privilege credentials to access your AWS resources. The permissions for each user are controlled through IAM roles that you create. You can define rules to choose the role for each user based on claims in the user's ID token. You can define a default role for authenticated users. You can also define a separate IAM role with limited permissions for guest users who are not authenticated.For machine identities, you should rely on IAM roles to grant access to AWS. For Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instances, you can use roles for Amazon EC2. You can attach an IAM role to your Amazon EC2 instance to enable your applications running on Amazon EC2 to use temporary security credentials that AWS creates, distributes, and rotates automatically through the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). The latest version of IMDS helps protect against vulnerabilities that expose the temporary credentials and should be implemented. For accessing Amazon EC2 instances using keys or passwords, AWS Systems Manager is a more secure way to access and manage your instances using a pre- installed agent without the stored secret. Additionally, other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, enable you to configure an IAM service role to grant the service permissions to perform AWS actions using temporary credentials. In situations where you cannot use temporary credentials, use programmatic tools, such as AWS Secrets Manager, to automate credential rotation and management.Audit and rotate credentials periodically: Periodic validation, preferably through an automated tool, is necessary to verify that the correct controls are enforced. For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials. As you are moving from IAM users to centralized identities, you can generate a credential report to audit your IAM users. We also recommend that you enforce MFA settings in your identity provider. You can set up AWS Config Rules to monitor these settings. For machine identities, you should rely on temporary credentials using IAM roles. For situations where this is not possible, frequent auditing and rotating access keys is necessary.Store and use secrets securely: For credentials that are not IAM-related and cannot take advantage of temporary credentials, such as database logins, use a service that is designed to handle management of secrets, such as Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager makes it easy to manage, rotate, and securely store encrypted secrets using supported services. Calls to access the secrets are logged in AWS CloudTrail for auditing purposes, and IAM permissions can grant least-privilege access to them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement least privilege policies: Assign access policies with least privilege to IAM groups and roles to reflect the user's role or function that you have defined.Grant least privilegeRemove unnecessary permissions: Implement least privilege by removing permissions that are unnecessary.Reducing policy scope by viewing user activityView role accessConsider permissions boundaries: A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy that sets the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.Lab: IAM permissions boundaries delegating role creationConsider resource tags for permissions: You can use tags to control access to your AWS resources that support tagging. You can also tag IAM users and roles to control what they can access.Lab: IAM tag based access control for EC2Attribute-based access control (ABAC)Related documents:Getting Started with AWS Secrets ManagerIAM Best PracticesIdentity Providers and FederationSecurity Partner Solutions: Access and Access ControlTemporary Security CredentialsThe AWS Account Root UserRelated videos:Best Practices for Managing, Retrieving, and Rotating Secrets at ScaleManaging user permissions at scale with AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)Mastering identity at every layer of the cake\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining when to federate a directory service with IAM roles\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best practice for granting consumers access to a healthcare company's AWS resources, while storing and processing sensitive patient information in the cloud?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Federate with AWS IAM roles to access AWS accounts\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Federation with AWS IAM roles should be used for workforce identities, not for granting consumers access to AWS resources.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use Amazon Cognito identity pools and assign them a set of temporary, limited privilege credentials to access AWS resources\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Using Amazon Cognito identity pools and assigning them a set of temporary, limited privilege credentials to access AWS resources is the best practice for granting consumers access to a healthcare company's AWS resources while storing and processing sensitive patient information in the cloud.\"},{\"answer\": \"Grant consumers access to AWS resources using IAM users with long-term access keys\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"IAM users with long-term access keys should not be used for granting consumers access to AWS resources, as this increases the risk for vulnerabilities.\"},{\"answer\": \"Grant consumers access to AWS resources using AWS Single Sign-On\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Single Sign-On is the predecessor to AWS IAM Identity Center, and should not be used for granting consumers access to AWS resources.\"}]}", "docs": ["('SEC02-BP02 Use temporary credentials - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_identities_unique.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A manufacturing company wants to use AWS to optimize their supply chain and production processes.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design secure workloads and applications", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Application configuration and credentials security", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Use tools and automation to test and validate all security controls continuously. For example, scan items such as machine images and infrastructure-as-code templates for security vulnerabilities, irregularities, and drift from an established baseline at each stage. AWS CloudFormation Guard can help you verify that CloudFormation templates are safe, save you time, and reduce the risk of configuration error.Reducing the number of security misconfigurations introduced into a production environment is critical\u2014the more quality control and reduction of defects you can perform in the build process, the better. Design continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to test for security issues whenever possible. CI/CD pipelines offer the opportunity to enhance security at each stage of build and delivery. CI/CD security tooling must also be kept updated to mitigate evolving threats.Track changes to your workload configuration to help with compliance auditing, change management, and investigations that may apply to you. You can use AWS Config to record and evaluate your AWS and third-party resources. It allows you to continuously audit and assess the overall compliance with rules and conformance packs, which are collections of rules with remediation actions.Change tracking should include planned changes, which are part of your organization\u2019s change control process (sometimes referred to as MACD\u2014Move, Add, Change, Delete), unplanned changes, and unexpected changes, such as incidents. Changes might occur on the infrastructure, but they might also be related to other categories, such as changes in code repositories, machine images and application inventory changes, process and policy changes, or documentation changes.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumAutomate configuration management: Enforce and validate secure configurations automatically by using a configuration management service or tool.AWS Systems ManagerAWS CloudFormationSet Up a CI/CD Pipeline on AWSRelated documents:How to use service control policies to set permission guardrails across accounts in your AWS OrganizationRelated videos:Managing Multi-Account AWS Environments Using AWS OrganizationsSecurity Best Practices the Well-Architected Way\n* There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:Implement a strong identity foundation: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.Enable traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system, application, and code).Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.\n* Each component or resource of your workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.Common anti-patterns:Hard-coding or storing secrets in your application.Granting custom permissions for each user.Using long-lived credentials.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEach component or resource of your workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.Regular access to AWS accounts within the organization should be provided using federated access or a centralized identity provider. You should also centralize your identity management and ensure that there is an established practice to integrate AWS access to your employee access lifecycle. For example, when an employee changes to a job role with a different access level, their group membership should also change to reflect their new access requirements.When defining access requirements for non-human identities, determine which applications and components need access and how permissions are granted. Using IAM roles built with the least privilege access model is a recommended approach. AWS Managed policies provide predefined IAM policies that cover most common use cases.AWS services, such as AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, can help decouple secrets from the application or workload securely in cases where it's not feasible to use IAM roles. In Secrets Manager, you can establish automatic rotation for your credentials. You can use Systems Manager to reference parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, configuration, and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.You can use AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere to obtain temporary security credentials in IAM for workloads that run outside of AWS. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and IAM roles that you use with AWS applications to access AWS resources.Where possible, prefer short-term temporary credentials over long-term static credentials. For scenarios in which you need IAM users with programmatic access and long-term credentials, use access key last used information to rotate and remove access keys.Related documents:Attribute-based access control (ABAC)AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)IAM Roles AnywhereAWS Managed policies for IAM Identity CenterAWS IAM policy conditionsIAM use casesRemove unnecessary credentialsWorking with PoliciesHow to control access to AWS resources based on AWS account, OU, or organizationIdentify, arrange, and manage secrets easily using enhanced search in AWS Secrets ManagerRelated videos:Become an IAM Policy Master in 60 Minutes or LessSeparation of Duties, Least Privilege, Delegation, and CI/CDStreamlining identity and access management for innovation\n\nKnowledge Area: Application configuration and credentials security\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best approach to secure configuration and credentials for the manufacturing company's workload in the AWS environment?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Managed Policies to provide predefined IAM policies for access to each component\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Managed policies provide predefined IAM policies that cover most common use cases and can help manage access to each component of the workload.\"},{\"answer\": \"Hard-code or store secrets in the application\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"This is an anti-pattern and should be avoided as it exposes the workload to high levels of risk.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use long-term, static credentials\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"This is an anti-pattern and should be avoided as it exposes the workload to high levels of risk.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use IAM roles with least privilege access\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Using IAM roles with least privilege access can help ensure that only the necessary components and resources of the workload have access and can prevent unnecessary access to the workload.\"}]}", "docs": ["('SEC01-BP06 Automate testing and validation of security controls in pipelines - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_securely_operate_test_validate_pipeline.html')", "('Design principles - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-design.html')", "('SEC03-BP01 Define access requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_define.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to store log files from their applications for analysis and compliance purposes.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design secure workloads and applications", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "AWS service endpoints", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users. AWS Shield provides automatic protection against these attacks at no extra cost for AWS service endpoints on your workload. You can augment these features with virtual appliances from APN Partners and the AWS Marketplace to meet your needs.Common anti-patterns:Using public internet addresses on instances or containers and managing the connectivity to them via DNS.Using Internet Protocol addresses instead of domain names for locating services.Providing content (web pages, static assets, media files) to a large geographic area and not using a content delivery network.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By implementing highly available services in your workload, you know that your workload will be available to your users.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnsure that you have highly available connectivity for users of the workload Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public facing endpoints.

You can inspect your VPC configurations for potential unintended access using VPC Network Access Analyzer. You can specify your network access requirements and identify potential network paths that do not meet them. For components transacting over HTTP-based protocols, a web application firewall can help protect from common attacks. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and block HTTP(s) requests that match your configurable rules that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront, or an Application Load Balancer. To get started with AWS WAF, you can use AWS Managed Rules in combination with your own, or use existing partner integrations.For managing AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups across AWS Organizations, you can use AWS Firewall Manager. It allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules across your accounts and applications, making it easier to scale enforcement of common rules. It also enables you to rapidly respond to attacks, using AWS Shield Advanced, or solutions that can automatically block unwanted requests to your web applications. Firewall Manager also works with AWS Network Firewall. AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that uses a rules engine to give you fine-grained control over both stateful and stateless network traffic. It supports the Suricata compatible open source intrusion prevention system (IPS) specifications for rules to help protect your workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowConfigure Amazon GuardDuty: GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads. Enable GuardDuty and configure automated alerts.Amazon GuardDutyLab: Automated Deployment of Detective ControlsConfigure virtual private cloud (VPC) Flow Logs: VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.Consider VPC traffic mirroring: Traffic mirroring is an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then send it to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for content inspection, threat monitoring, and troubleshooting.VPC traffic mirroringRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorAmazon VPC SecurityGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n* When architecting your network topology, you should examine the connectivity requirements of each component. For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers.A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules.Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs. Many AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, support VPC endpoints, and this technology has been generalized in AWS PrivateLink. We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely. All network traffic on AWS PrivateLink stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the internet. Connectivity can only be initiated by the consumer of the service, and not by the provider of the service. Using AWS PrivateLink for external service access allows you to create air-gapped VPCs with no internet access and helps protect your VPCs from external threat vectors. Third-party services can use AWS PrivateLink to allow their customers to connect to the services from their VPCs over private IP addresses. For VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web proxies that you create and manage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighControl network traffic in a VPC: Implement VPC best practices to control traffic.Amazon VPC securityVPC endpointsAmazon VPC security groupNetwork ACLsControl traffic at the edge: Implement edge services, such as Amazon CloudFront, to provide an additional layer of protection and other features.Amazon CloudFront use casesAWS Global AcceleratorAWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)Amazon Route 53Amazon VPC Ingress RoutingControl private network traffic: Implement services that protect your private traffic for your workload.Amazon VPC PeeringAmazon VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)Amazon VPC Transit GatewayAWS Direct ConnectAWS Site-to-Site VPNAWS Client VPNAmazon S3 Access PointsRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n\nKnowledge Area: Control ports, protocols, and network traffic on AWS\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following best practices should you implement to control network traffic in a VPC?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Configure Amazon GuardDuty\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.\"},{\"answer\": \"Implement VPC endpoints\",\"is_correct\": \"True\", \"explanation\": \"VPC endpoints allow components to access AWS services without traversing the internet or leaving the Amazon VPC.

Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system, application, and code).Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements.

Using automation for this instead of direct access from a person reduces the risk of human error and exposure. You should evaluate using a tool, such as Amazon Macie, that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS.

You can fully automate identity management, network security, data protection, and monitoring capabilities and deliver them using popular software development methods that you already have in place. When you build security automation, your system can monitor, review, and initiate a response, rather than having people monitor your security position and manually react to events. An effective way to automatically provide searchable and relevant log data across AWS services to your incident responders is to enable Amazon Detective.If your incident response teams continue to respond to alerts in the same way, they risk alert fatigue. Over time, the team can become desensitized to alerts and can either make mistakes handling ordinary situations or miss unusual alerts. Automation helps avoid alert fatigue by using functions that process the repetitive and ordinary alerts, leaving humans to handle the sensitive and unique incidents. Integrating anomaly detection systems, such as Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail Insights, and Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection, can reduce the burden of common threshold-based alerts.You can improve manual processes by programmatically automating steps in the process. After you define the remediation pattern to an event, you can decompose that pattern into actionable logic, and write the code to perform that logic. Responders can then execute that code to remediate the issue. Over time, you can automate more and more steps, and ultimately automatically handle whole classes of common incidents.For tools that execute within the operating system of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, you should evaluate using the AWS Systems Manager Run Command, which enables you to remotely and securely administrate instances using an agent that you install on your Amazon EC2 instance operating system. It requires the Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent), which is installed by default on many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Be aware, though, that once an instance has been compromised, no responses from tools or agents running on it should be considered trustworthy.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowPre-deploy tools: Ensure that security personnel have the right tools pre-deployed in AWS so that an appropriate response can be made to an incident.Lab: Incident response with AWS Management Console and CLIIncident Response Playbook with Jupyter - AWS IAMAWS Security AutomationImplement resource tagging: Tag resources with information, such as a code for the resource under investigation, so that you can identify resources during an incident.AWS Tagging StrategiesRelated documents:AWS Incident Response GuideRelated videos:DIY guide to runbooks, incident reports, and incident response\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Use of these methodologies is critical for successful, ongoing operations in either the cloud or on-premises.In AWS, you can implement stateful and stateless packet inspection, either by using AWS-native technologies or by using partner products and services available through the AWS Marketplace. You should use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private, secured, and scalable environment in which you can define your topology\u2014including gateways, routing tables, and public and private subnets.The following questions focus on these considerations for security.Multiple layers of defense are advisable in any type of environment. In the case of infrastructure protection, many of the concepts and methods are valid across cloud and on-premises models. Enforcing boundary protection, monitoring points of ingress and egress, and comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting are all essential to an effective information security plan.AWS customers are able to tailor, or harden, the configuration of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance, and persist this configuration to an immutable Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Then, whether triggered by Auto Scaling or launched manually, all new virtual servers (instances) launched with this AMI receive the hardened configuration.SEC 5: How do you protect your network resources?Any workload that has some form of network connectivity, whether it\u2019s the internet or a private network, requires multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal network-based threats.SEC 6: How do you protect your compute resources?Compute resources in your workload require multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal threats. Compute resources include EC2 instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database services, IoT devices, and more.\n* Design and configure your workload to emit information about the status (for example, reachability or response time) of resources it depends on. Examples of external dependencies can include, external databases, DNS, and network connectivity. Use this information to determine when a response is required.Common anti-patterns:You are unable to determine if the reason your application is unreachable is a DNS issue without manually performing a check to see if your DNS provider is working.Your shopping cart application is unable to complete transactions.

For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers.A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules.Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs. Many AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, support VPC endpoints, and this technology has been generalized in AWS PrivateLink. We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely. All network traffic on AWS PrivateLink stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the internet. Connectivity can only be initiated by the consumer of the service, and not by the provider of the service. Using AWS PrivateLink for external service access allows you to create air-gapped VPCs with no internet access and helps protect your VPCs from external threat vectors. Third-party services can use AWS PrivateLink to allow their customers to connect to the services from their VPCs over private IP addresses. For VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web proxies that you create and manage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighControl network traffic in a VPC: Implement VPC best practices to control traffic.Amazon VPC securityVPC endpointsAmazon VPC security groupNetwork ACLsControl traffic at the edge: Implement edge services, such as Amazon CloudFront, to provide an additional layer of protection and other features.Amazon CloudFront use casesAWS Global AcceleratorAWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)Amazon Route 53Amazon VPC Ingress RoutingControl private network traffic: Implement services that protect your private traffic for your workload.Amazon VPC PeeringAmazon VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)Amazon VPC Transit GatewayAWS Direct ConnectAWS Site-to-Site VPNAWS Client VPNAmazon S3 Access PointsRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n* Group components that share reachability requirements into layers. For example, a database cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet.

This includes load balancers, EC2 instances, and container-based applications.When you plan your network topology, the first step is to define the IP address space itself. Private IP address ranges (following RFC 1918 guidelines) should be allocated for each VPC. Accommodate the following requirements as part of this process:Allow IP address space for more than one VPC per Region.Within a VPC, allow space for multiple subnets that span multiple Availability Zones.Always leave unused CIDR block space within a VPC for future expansion.Ensure that there is IP address space to meet the needs of any transient fleets of EC2 instances that you might use, such as Spot Fleets for machine learning, Amazon EMR clusters, or Amazon Redshift clusters.Note that the first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are reserved and not available for your use.You should plan on deploying large VPC CIDR blocks. Note that the initial VPC CIDR block allocated to your VPC cannot be changed or deleted, but you can add additional non-overlapping CIDR blocks to the VPC. Subnet IPv4 CIDRs cannot be changed, however IPv6 CIDRs can. Keep in mind that deploying the largest VPC possible (/16) results in over 65,000 IP addresses. In the base 10.x.x.x IP address space alone, you could provision 255 such VPCs. You should therefore err on the side of being too large rather than too small to make it easier to manage your VPCs.Common anti-patterns:Creating small VPCs.Creating small subnets and then having to add subnets to configurations as you grow.Incorrectly estimating how many IP addresses a elastic load balancer can use.Deploying many high traffic load balancers into the same subnets.Benefits of establishing this best practice: This ensures that you can accommodate the growth of your workloads and continue to provide availability as you scale up.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumPlan your network to accommodate for growth, regulatory compliance, and integration with others. Growth can be underestimated, regulatory compliance can change, and acquisitions or private network connections can be difficult to implement without proper planning.Select relevant AWS accounts and Regions based on your service requirements, latency, regulatory, and disaster recovery (DR) requirements.Identify your needs for regional VPC deployments.Identify the size of the VPCs.Determine if you are going to deploy multi-VPC connectivity.What Is a Transit Gateway?Single Region Multi-VPC ConnectivityDetermine if you need segregated networking for regulatory requirements.Make VPCs as large as possible. The initial VPC CIDR block allocated to your VPC cannot be changed or deleted, but you can add additional non-overlapping CIDR blocks to the VPC. This however may fragment your address ranges.Related documents:APN Partner: partners that can help plan your networkingAWS Marketplace for Network InfrastructureAmazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options WhitepaperMultiple data center HA network connectivitySingle Region Multi-VPC ConnectivityWhat Is Amazon VPC?Related videos:AWS re:Invent 2018: Advanced VPC Design and New Capabilities for Amazon VPC (NET303)AWS re:Invent 2019: AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCs (NET406-R1)\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining network segmentation strategies (for example, using public subnets and private subnets)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is a best practice for creating a network segmentation strategy within AWS?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"Create multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone and associate them with a route table.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"Subnets should span multiple Availability Zones.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Create subnets in VPC, associate route tables with each subnet, and plan for future expansion.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\", \"explanation\": \"This ensures that you can accommodate the growth of your workloads and continue to provide availability as you scale up.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Deploy large VPC CIDR blocks in the first four IP addresses in each subnet CIDR block.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are reserved and not available for your use.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Deploy many high traffic load balancers into the same subnets.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"High traffic load balancers should be deployed into different subnets to maximize efficiency.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('SEC05-BP01 Create network layers - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html')", "('REL02-BP03 Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion and availability - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_planning_network_topology_ip_subnet_allocation.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A telecommunications company wants to use AWS to host and manage their network infrastructure.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design secure workloads and applications", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Integrating AWS services to secure applications (for example, AWS Shield, AWS WAF, AWS SSO, AWS Secrets Manager)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Centralize identity management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.Enable traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system, application, and code).Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n* There are six best practice areas for security in the cloud:SecurityIdentity and Access ManagementDetectionInfrastructure ProtectionData ProtectionIncident ResponseBefore you architect any workload, you need to put in place practices that influence security. You will want to control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.The AWS Shared Responsibility Model enables organizations that adopt the cloud to achieve their security and compliance goals. Because AWS physically secures the infrastructure that supports our cloud services, as an AWS customer you can focus on using services to accomplish your goals. The AWS Cloud also provides greater access to security data and an automated approach to responding to security events.\n* Automate your protective compute mechanisms including vulnerability management, reduction in attack surface, and management of resources.

This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).

For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery. Also look for caching services where there is repeated access to data, or large amounts of data.Related documents:AWS Direct ConnectAWS Explore Our ProductsAWS caching solutionsAmazon CloudFrontDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n* When architecting your network topology, you should examine the connectivity requirements of each component. For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers.A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups.

Aspects including the duration for which you retain data, data destruction processes, data access management, data transformation, and data sharing should be considered. When choosing a data classification methodology, balance usability versus access. You should also accommodate the multiple levels of access and nuances for implementing a secure, but still usable, approach for each level. Always use a defense in depth approach and reduce human access to data and mechanisms for transforming, deleting, or copying data. For example, require users to strongly authenticate to an application, and give the application, rather than the users, the requisite access permission to perform action at a distance. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted network path and require access to the decryption keys. Use tools, such as dashboards and automated reporting, to give users information from the data rather than giving them direct access to the data.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIdentify data types: Identify the types of data that you are storing or processing in your workload. That data could be text, images, binary databases, and so forth.Related documents:Data Classification WhitepaperGetting started with Amazon MacieRelated videos:Introducing the New Amazon Macie\n* Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your workload, and the resources required to use it. Understand your data, and use storage technologies and configurations that best support the business value of the data and how it\u2019s used. Lifecycle data to more efficient, less performant storage when requirements decrease, and delete data that\u2019s no longer required.Best practices:\n* Use the access patterns of the workload to decide which services and technologies to use. In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries. Considerations around highly specialized query functionality for text and natural language processing, time series, and graphs must also be taken into account.Desired outcome: The data storage has been selected based on identified and documented data access patterns. This might include the most common read, write and delete queries, the need for ad-hoc calculations and aggregations, complexity of the data, the data interdependency, and the required consistency needs.Common anti-patterns:You only select one database vendor to simplify operations management.You assume that data access patterns will stay consistent over time.You implement complex transactions, rollback, and consistency logic in the application.The database is configured to support a potential high traffic burst, which results in the database resources remaining idle most of the time.Using a shared database for transactional and analytical uses.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and optimizing your data storage based on access patterns will help decrease development complexity and optimize your performance opportunities. Understanding when to use read replicas, global tables, data partitioning, and caching will help you decrease operational overhead and scale based on your workload needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumIdentify and evaluate your data access pattern to select the correct storage configuration. Each database solution has options to configure and optimize your storage solution. Use the collected metrics and logs and experiment with options to find the optimal configuration. Use the following table to review storage options per database service.Implementation steps:Identify and document the anticipated growth of the data and traffic.Amazon RDS and Aurora support storage automatic scaling up to documented limits. Beyond this, consider transitioning older data to Amazon S3 for archival, aggregating historical data for analytics or scaling horizontally via sharding.DynamoDB and Amazon S3 will scale to near limitless storage volume automatically.Amazon RDS instances and databases running on EC2 can be manually resized and EC2 instances can have new EBS volumes added at a later date for additional storage.Instance types can be changed based on changes in activity. For example, you can start with a smaller instance while you are testing, then scale the instance as you begin to receive production traffic to the service. Aurora Serverless V2 automatically scales in response to changes in load.Document requirements around normal and peak performance (transactions per second TPS and queries per second QPS) and consistency (ACID and eventual consistency).Document solution deployment aspects and the database access requirements (global, Mult-AZ, read replication, multiple write nodes)Level of effort for the implementation plan: If you do not have logs or metrics for your data management solution, you will need to complete that before identifying and documenting your data access patterns. Once your data access pattern is understood, selecting, and configuring your data storage is a low level of effort.Related documents:AWS Database CachingAmazon Athena top 10 performance tipsAmazon Aurora best practicesAmazon DynamoDB AcceleratorAmazon DynamoDB best practicesAmazon Redshift Spectrum best practicesAmazon Redshift performanceCloud Databases with AWSAmazon RDS Storage TypesRelated videos:AWS purpose-built databases (DAT209-L)Amazon Aurora storage demystified: How it all works (DAT309-R)Amazon DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns (DAT403-R1)Related examples:Experiment and test with Distributed Load Testing on AWSAWS ServicesAmazon RDS, Amazon AuroraAmazon DynamoDBAmazon DocumentDBAmazon ElastiCacheAmazon NeptuneAmazon TimestreamAmazon KeyspacesAmazon QLDBScaling StorageStorage automatic scaling option available to automatically scale provisioned storage IOPS can also be scaled independently of provisioned storage when leveraging provisioned IOPs storage typesAutomatically scales.

Choose a strategy such as: backup and restore; standby (active/passive); or active/active.\n* To minimize storage consumption, only back up data that has business value or is needed to satisfy compliance requirements. Examine backup policies and exclude ephemeral storage that doesn\u2019t provide value in a recovery scenario.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowUse your data classification to establish what data needs to be backed up.Exclude data that you can easily recreate.Exclude ephemeral data from your backups.Exclude local copies of data, unless the time required to restore that data from a common location exceeds your service level agreements (SLAs).Related documents:Using AWS Backup to back up and restore Amazon EFS file systemsAmazon EBS snapshotsWorking with backups on Amazon Relational Database Service\n* Regularly test failover to your recovery site to ensure proper operation, and that RTO and RPO are met.A pattern to avoid is developing recovery paths that are rarely exercised. For example, you might have a secondary data store that is used for read-only queries. When you write to a data store and the primary fails, you might want to fail over to the secondary data store. If you don\u2019t frequently test this failover, you might find that your assumptions about the capabilities of the secondary data store are incorrect. The capacity of the secondary, which might have been sufficient when you last tested, might be no longer be able to tolerate the load under this scenario. Our experience has shown that the only error recovery that works is the path you test frequently. This is why having a small number of recovery paths is best. You can establish recovery patterns and regularly test them. If you have a complex or critical recovery path, you still need to regularly exercise that failure in production to convince yourself that the recovery path works. In the example we just discussed, you should fail over to the standby regularly, regardless of need.Common anti-patterns:Never exercise failovers in production.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Regularly testing you disaster recovery plan ensures that it will work when it needs to, and that your team knows how to execute the strategy.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEngineer your workloads for recovery.

This may include classifications to indicate if the data is intended to be publicly available, if the data is internal use only such as customer personally identifiable information (PII), or if the data is for more restricted access such as intellectual property, legally privileged or marked sensitive, and more. By carefully managing an appropriate data classification system, along with each workload\u2019s level of protection requirements, you can map the controls and level of access or protection appropriate for the data. For example, public content is available for anyone to access, but important content is encrypted and stored in a protected manner that requires authorized access to a key for decrypting the content.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighConsider discovering data using Amazon Macie: Macie recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property.Amazon MacieRelated documents:Amazon MacieData Classification WhitepaperGetting started with Amazon MacieRelated videos:Introducing the New Amazon Macie\n* Your defined lifecycle strategy should be based on sensitivity level as well as legal and organization requirements.

For example, data classification provides a way to categorize organizational data based on levels of sensitivity, and encryption protects data by way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized access. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.In AWS, the following practices facilitate protection of data:As an AWS customer you maintain full control over your data.AWS makes it easier for you to encrypt your data and manage keys, including regular key rotation, which can be easily automated by AWS or maintained by you.Detailed logging that contains important content, such as file access and changes, is available.AWS has designed storage systems for exceptional resiliency. For example, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard\u2013IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and Amazon Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects.Versioning, which can be part of a larger data lifecycle management process, can protect against accidental overwrites, deletes, and similar harm.AWS never initiates the movement of data between Regions. Content placed in a Region will remain in that Region unless you explicitly enable a feature or leverage a service that provides that functionality.The following questions focus on these considerations for security.AWS provides multiple means for encrypting data at rest and in transit. We build features into our services that make it easier to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for the entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).SEC 7: How do you classify your data?Classification provides a way to categorize data, based on criticality and sensitivity in order to help you determine appropriate protection and retention controls.SEC 8: How do you protect your data at rest?Protect your data at rest by implementing multiple controls, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.SEC 9: How do you protect your data in transit?Protect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss.\n\nKnowledge Area: Data retention and classification\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What best practice should a retail company use when leveraging AWS to support their e-commerce platform during peak shopping seasons to determine appropriate protection and retention controls?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Deploy Amazon Macie to discover sensitive data\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon Macie is used for discovering sensitive data, but first you need to classify the data to understand its significance to business outcomes before you can determine appropriate protection and retention controls.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use tagging to record metadata of data\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Using tagging on volumes and objects can help to record the metadata that's used to determine how it's managed, including data classification.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Audit environment for unclassified data\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Periodically audit the environment for untagged and unclassified data, and classify and tag the data appropriately.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Encrypt important content\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Encrypting important content is important, but it should be based on the sensitivity level as well as legal and organization requirements after classifying the data.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('SUS04-BP01 Implement a data classification policy - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_data_a2.html')", "('SEC 7\\xa0 How do you classify your data? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-07.html')", "('SEC07-BP01 Identify the data within your workload - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html')", "('SEC07-BP04 Define data lifecycle management - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_data_classification_lifecycle_management.html')", "('Data protection - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-dataprot.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A healthcare company wants to store and process sensitive patient information in the cloud.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine appropriate data security controls", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Encryption and appropriate key management", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) helps you manage encryption keys and integrates with many AWS services. This service provides durable, secure, and redundant storage for your AWS KMS keys. You can define your key aliases as well as key-level policies. The policies help you define key administrators as well as key users. Additionally, AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys in the AWS Cloud. It helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement AWS KMS: AWS KMS makes it easy for you to create and manage keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications.

The best way to accomplish this is to use a managed service, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). It lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the internet as well as resources on private networks. ACM integrates with AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), AWS distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, also handling automatic certificate renewals. If you use ACM to deploy a private root CA, both certificates and private keys can be provided by it for use in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, and so on.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement secure key and certificate management: Implement your defined secure key and certificate management solution.AWS Certificate ManagerHow to host and manage an entire private certificate infrastructure in AWSImplement secure protocols: Use secure protocols that offer authentication and confidentiality, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec, to reduce the risk of data tampering or loss.

Prevent and detect if data integrity of backups is compromised using encryption.Amazon S3 supports several methods of encryption of your data at rest. Using server-side encryption, Amazon S3 accepts your objects as unencrypted data, and then encrypts them as they are stored. Using client-side encryption, your workload application is responsible for encrypting the data before it is sent to Amazon S3. Both methods allow you to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to create and store the data key, or you can provide your own key, which you are then responsible for. Using AWS KMS, you can set policies using IAM on who can and cannot access your data keys and decrypted data.For Amazon RDS, if you have chosen to encrypt your databases, then your backups are encrypted also. DynamoDB backups are always encrypted.Common anti-patterns:Having the same access to the backups and restoration automation as you do to the data.Not encrypting your backups.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Securing your backups prevents tampering with the data, and encryption of the data prevents access to that data if it is accidentally exposed.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse encryption on each of your data stores. If your source data is encrypted, then the backup will also be encrypted.Enable encryption in RDS.

You will want to control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.The AWS Shared Responsibility Model enables organizations that adopt the cloud to achieve their security and compliance goals. Because AWS physically secures the infrastructure that supports our cloud services, as an AWS customer you can focus on using services to accomplish your goals. The AWS Cloud also provides greater access to security data and an automated approach to responding to security events.\n* As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective.Best practices\n* There are four best practice areas for performance efficiency in the cloud:SelectionReviewMonitoringTradeoffsTake a data-driven approach to building a high-performance architecture. Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from the high-level design to the selection and configuration of resource types.Reviewing your choices on a regular basis ensures that you are taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring ensures that you are aware of any deviance from expected performance. Make trade-o\ufb00s in your architecture to improve performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing consistency requirements.\n* Share best practices across teams to increase awareness and maximize the benefits of development efforts.On AWS, application, compute, infrastructure, and operations can be defined and managed using code methodologies. This allows for easy release, sharing, and adoption.Many AWS services and resources are designed to be shared across accounts, enabling you to share created assets and learnings across your teams. For example, you can share CodeCommit repositories, Lambda functions, Amazon S3 buckets, and AMIs to specific accounts.When you publish new resources or updates, use Amazon SNS to provide cross account notifications. Subscribers can use Lambda to get new versions.If shared standards are enforced in your organization, it\u2019s critical that mechanisms exist to request additions, changes, and exceptions to standards in support of teams\u2019 activities. Without this option, standards become a constraint on innovation.Common anti-patterns:You have created your own user authentication mechanism, as have each of the other development teams in your organization. Your users have to maintain a separate set of credentials for each part of the system they want to access.You have created your own user authentication mechanism, as have each of the other development teams in your organization. Your organization is given a new compliance requirement that must be met. Every individual development team must now invest the resources to implement the new requirement.You have created your own screen layout, as have each of the other development teams in your organization. Your users are complaining about the difficulty of navigating the inconsistent interfaces.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Use shared standards to support the adoption of best practices and to maximizes the benefits of development efforts where standards satisfy requirements for multiple applications or organizations.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumShare design standards: Share existing best practices, design standards, checklists, operating procedures, and guidance and governance requirements across teams to reduce complexity and maximize the benefits from development efforts. Ensure that procedures exist to request changes, additions, and exceptions to design standards to support continual improvement and innovation. Ensure that teams are aware of published content so that they can take advantage of content, and limit rework and wasted effort.Delegating access to your AWS environmentShare an AWS CodeCommit repositoryEasy authorization of AWS Lambda functionsSharing an AMI with specific AWS accountsSpeed template sharing with an AWS CloudFormation designer URLUsing AWS Lambda with Amazon SNSRelated documents:Easy authorization of AWS Lambda functionsShare an AWS CodeCommit repositorySharing an AMI with specific AWS accountsSpeed template sharing with an AWS CloudFormation designer URLUsing AWS Lambda with Amazon SNSRelated videos:Delegating access to your AWS environment\n\nKnowledge Area: Aligning AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best practice to align AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Share design standards and procedures to request changes and additions\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Sharing design standards and procedures to request changes and additions is the best practice to align AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements.\"},{\"answer\": \"Share an AWS CodeCommit repository\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Sharing an AWS CodeCommit repository is not the best practice to align AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements.\"},{\"answer\": \"Delegating access to your AWS environment\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Delegating access to your AWS environment is not the best practice to align AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements.\"},{\"answer\": \"Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SNS\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SNS is not the best practice to align AWS technologies to meet compliance requirements.\"}]}", "docs": ["('SEC01-BP03 Identify and validate control objectives - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_securely_operate_control_objectives.html')", "('Resources - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-resources.html')", "('Further reading - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/further-reading.html')", "('Definition - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-def.html')", "('COST 10\\xa0 How do you evaluate new services? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-10.html')", "('Definition - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-def.html')", "('OPS05-BP06 Share design standards - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_dev_integ_share_design_stds.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to run a disaster recovery plan for their critical systems on AWS.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine appropriate data security controls", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Encrypting data at rest (for example, AWS Key Management Service [AWS KMS])", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) integrates seamlessly with many AWS services to make it easier for you to encrypt all your data at rest. For example, in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), you can set default encryption on a bucket so that all new objects are automatically encrypted. Additionally, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon S3 support the enforcement of encryption by setting default encryption.

The best way to accomplish this is to use a managed service, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). It lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the internet as well as resources on private networks. ACM integrates with AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), AWS distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, also handling automatic certificate renewals. If you use ACM to deploy a private root CA, both certificates and private keys can be provided by it for use in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, and so on.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement secure key and certificate management: Implement your defined secure key and certificate management solution.AWS Certificate ManagerHow to host and manage an entire private certificate infrastructure in AWSImplement secure protocols: Use secure protocols that offer authentication and confidentiality, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec, to reduce the risk of data tampering or loss. Check the AWS documentation for the protocols and security relevant to the services that you are using.Related documents:AWS Documentation\n* Enforce your defined encryption requirements based on appropriate standards and recommendations to help you meet your organizational, legal, and compliance requirements. AWS services provide HTTPS endpoints using TLS for communication, thus providing encryption in transit when communicating with the AWS APIs. Insecure protocols, such as HTTP, can be audited and blocked in a VPC through the use of security groups. HTTP requests can also be automatically redirected to HTTPS in Amazon CloudFront or on an Application Load Balancer. You have full control over your computing resources to implement encryption in transit across your services. Additionally, you can use VPN connectivity into your VPC from an external network to facilitate encryption of traffic. Third-party solutions are available in the AWS Marketplace, if you have special requirements.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnforce encryption in transit: Your defined encryption requirements should be based on the latest standards and best practices and only allow secure protocols. For example, only configure a security group to allow HTTPS protocol to an application load balancer or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.Configure secure protocols in edge services: Configure HTTPS with Amazon CloudFront and required ciphers.Using HTTPS with CloudFrontUse a VPN for external connectivity: Consider using an IPsec virtual private network (VPN) for securing point-to-point or network-to-network connections to provide both data privacy and integrity.VPN connectionsConfigure secure protocols in load balancers: Enable HTTPS listener for securing connections to load balancers.HTTPS listeners for your application load balancerConfigure secure protocols for instances: Consider configuring HTTPS encryption on instances.Tutorial: Configure Apache web server on Amazon Linux 2 to use SSL/TLSConfigure secure protocols in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS): Use secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt connection to database instances.Using SSL to encrypt a connection to a DB InstanceConfigure secure protocols in Amazon Redshift: Configure your cluster to require an secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) connection.Configure security options for connectionsConfigure secure protocols in additional AWS services For the AWS services you use, determine the encryption-in-transit capabilities.Related documents:AWS documentation\n* Verify the identity of communications by using protocols that support authentication, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec.Using network protocols that support authentication, allows for trust to be established between the parties. This adds to the encryption used in the protocol to reduce the risk of communications being altered or intercepted. Common protocols that implement authentication include Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is used in many AWS services, and IPsec, which is used in AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN).Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowImplement secure protocols: Use secure protocols that offer authentication and confidentiality, such as TLS or IPsec, to reduce the risk of data tampering or loss. Check the AWS documentation for the protocols and security relevant to the services you are using.Related documents:AWS Documentation\n* Before architecting any system, foundational practices that influence security should be in place. For example, data classification provides a way to categorize organizational data based on levels of sensitivity, and encryption protects data by way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized access. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.In AWS, the following practices facilitate protection of data:As an AWS customer you maintain full control over your data.AWS makes it easier for you to encrypt your data and manage keys, including regular key rotation, which can be easily automated by AWS or maintained by you.Detailed logging that contains important content, such as file access and changes, is available.AWS has designed storage systems for exceptional resiliency. For example, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard\u2013IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and Amazon Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects.Versioning, which can be part of a larger data lifecycle management process, can protect against accidental overwrites, deletes, and similar harm.AWS never initiates the movement of data between Regions. Content placed in a Region will remain in that Region unless you explicitly enable a feature or leverage a service that provides that functionality.The following questions focus on these considerations for security.AWS provides multiple means for encrypting data at rest and in transit. We build features into our services that make it easier to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for the entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).SEC 7: How do you classify your data?Classification provides a way to categorize data, based on criticality and sensitivity in order to help you determine appropriate protection and retention controls.SEC 8: How do you protect your data at rest?Protect your data at rest by implementing multiple controls, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.SEC 9: How do you protect your data in transit?Protect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss.\n\nKnowledge Area: Encrypting data in transit (for example, AWS Certificate Manager [ACM] using TLS)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What is the best practice for the organization to use to encrypt data in transit, such as certificates and keys, in order to deliver online learning courses to students globally?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"Configure secure protocols on the Amazon CloudFront edge service\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is not the best option as this is only used to secure connections to the load balancers\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use an IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN)\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is not the best option as this is only used for point-to-point or network-to-network connections\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"ACM is the best option for this scenario as it lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private TLS certificates for use with AWS services and connected resources\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Configure secure protocols on instances\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is not the best option as this is used for configuring HTTPS encryption, not for encryption in transit\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('SEC09-BP01 Implement secure key and certificate management - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_data_transit_key_cert_mgmt.html')", "('SEC09-BP02 Enforce encryption in transit - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_data_transit_encrypt.html')", "('SEC09-BP04 Authenticate network communications - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_data_transit_authentication.html')", "('Data protection - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-dataprot.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to build a mobile application that needs to access and store data in the cloud.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine appropriate data security controls", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Implementing access policies for encryption keys", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Prevent operators from granting public access to your data.Different controls including access (using least privilege), backups (see Reliability whitepaper), isolation, and versioning can all help protect your data at rest. Access to your data should be audited using detective mechanisms covered earlier in this paper including CloudTrail, and service level log, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) access logs. You should inventory what data is publicly accessible, and plan for how you can reduce the amount of data available over time. Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock and Amazon S3 Object Lock are capabilities providing mandatory access control\u2014once a vault policy is locked with the compliance option, not even the root user can change it until the lock expires.

Prevent and detect if data integrity of backups is compromised using encryption.Amazon S3 supports several methods of encryption of your data at rest. Using server-side encryption, Amazon S3 accepts your objects as unencrypted data, and then encrypts them as they are stored. Using client-side encryption, your workload application is responsible for encrypting the data before it is sent to Amazon S3. Both methods allow you to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to create and store the data key, or you can provide your own key, which you are then responsible for. Using AWS KMS, you can set policies using IAM on who can and cannot access your data keys and decrypted data.For Amazon RDS, if you have chosen to encrypt your databases, then your backups are encrypted also. DynamoDB backups are always encrypted.Common anti-patterns:Having the same access to the backups and restoration automation as you do to the data.Not encrypting your backups.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Securing your backups prevents tampering with the data, and encryption of the data prevents access to that data if it is accidentally exposed.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse encryption on each of your data stores. If your source data is encrypted, then the backup will also be encrypted.Enable encryption in RDS. You can configure encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service when you create an RDS instance.Encrypting Amazon RDS ResourcesEnable encryption on EBS volumes. You can configure default encryption or specify a unique key upon volume creation.Amazon EBS EncryptionUse the required Amazon DynamoDB encryption. DynamoDB encrypts all data at rest.

Services such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB additionally support automated backup that enables point-in-time recovery (PITR), which allows you to restore a backup to any time up to five minutes or less before the current time. Many AWS services offer the ability to copy backups to another AWS Region. AWS Backup is a tool that gives you the ability to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services.Amazon S3 can be used as a backup destination for self-managed and AWS-managed data sources. AWS services such as Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB have built in capabilities to create backups. Third-party backup software can also be used.On-premises data can be backed up to the AWS Cloud using AWS Storage Gateway or AWS DataSync. Amazon S3 buckets can be used to store this data on AWS. Amazon S3 offers multiple storage tiers such as Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive to reduce cost of data storage.You might be able to meet data recovery needs by reproducing the data from other sources. For example, Amazon Elasticache replica nodes or RDS read replicas could be used to reproduce data if the primary is lost. In cases where sources like this can be used to meet your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO), you might not require a backup. Another example, if working with Amazon EMR, it might not be necessary to backup your HDFS data store, as long as you can reproduce the data into EMR from S3.When selecting a backup strategy, consider the time it takes to recover data. The time needed to recover data depends on the type of backup (in the case of a backup strategy), or the complexity of the data reproduction mechanism. This time should fall within the RTO for the workload.Desired Outcome:Data sources have been identified and classified based on criticality. Then, establish a strategy for data recovery based on the RPO. This strategy involves either backing up these data sources, or having the ability to reproduce data from other sources. In the case of data loss, the strategy implemented enables recovery or reproduction of data within the defined RPO and RTO.Cloud Maturity Phase: FoundationalCommon anti-patterns:Not aware of all data sources for the workload and their criticality.Not taking backups of critical data sources.Taking backups of only some data sources without using criticality as a criterion.No defined RPO, or backup frequency cannot meet RPO.Not evaluating if a backup is necessary or if data can be reproduced from other sources.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Identifying the places where backups are necessary and implementing a mechanism to create backups, or being able to reproduce the data from an external source improves the ability to restore and recover data during an outage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUnderstand and use the backup capabilities of the AWS services and resources used by the workload. Most AWS services provides capabilities to back up workload data.Implementation Steps:Identify all data sources for the workload. Data can be stored on a number of resources such as databases, volumes, filesystems, logging systems, and object storage. Refer to the Resources section to find Related documents on different AWS services where data is stored, and the backup capability these services provide.Classify data sources based on criticality. Different data sets will have different levels of criticality for a workload, and therefore different requirements for resiliency. For example, some data might be critical and require a RPO near zero, while other data might be less critical and can tolerate a higher RPO and some data loss. Similarly, different data sets might have different RTO requirements as well.Use AWS or third-party services to create backups of the data. AWS Backup is a managed service that enables creating backups of various data sources on AWS. Most of these services also have native capabilities to create backups. The AWS Marketplace has many solutions that provide these capabilites as well. Refer to the Resources listed below for information on how to create backups of data from various AWS services.For data that is not backed up, establish a data reproduction mechanism. You might choose not to backup data that can be reproduced from other sources for various reasons. There might be a situation where it is cheaper to reproduce data from sources when needed rather than creating a backup as there may be a cost associated with storing backups. Another example is where restoring from a backup takes longer than reproducing the data from sources, resulting in a breach in RTO. In such situations, consider tradeoffs and establish a well-defined process for how data can be reproduced from these sources when data recovery is necessary. For example, if you have loaded data from Amazon S3 to a data warehouse (like Amazon Redshift), or MapReduce cluster (like Amazon EMR) to do analysis on that data, this may be an example of data that can be reproduced from other sources. As long as the results of these analyses are either stored somewhere or reproducible, you would not suffer a data loss from a failure in the data warehouse or MapReduce cluster. Other examples that can be reproduced from sources include caches (like Amazon ElastiCache) or RDS read replicas.Establish a cadence for backing up data. Creating backups of data sources is a periodic process and the frequency should depend on the RPO.Level of effort for the Implementation Plan: ModerateRelated Best Practices:REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data lossREL13-BP02 Use defined recovery strategies to meet the recovery objectivesRelated documents:What Is AWS Backup?What is AWS DataSync?What is Volume Gateway?APN Partner: partners that can help with backupAWS Marketplace: products that can be used for backupAmazon EBS SnapshotsBacking Up Amazon EFSBacking up Amazon FSx for Windows File ServerBackup and Restore for ElastiCache for RedisCreating a DB Cluster Snapshot in NeptuneCreating a DB SnapshotCreating an EventBridge Rule That Triggers on a ScheduleCross-Region Replication with Amazon S3EFS-to-EFS AWS BackupExporting Log Data to Amazon S3Object lifecycle managementOn-Demand Backup and Restore for DynamoDBPoint-in-time recovery for DynamoDBWorking with Amazon OpenSearch Service Index SnapshotsRelated videos:AWS re:Invent 2021 - Backup, disaster recovery, and ransomware protection with AWSAWS Backup Demo: Cross-Account and Cross-Region BackupAWS re:Invent 2019: Deep dive on AWS Backup, ft.

Aspects including the duration for which you retain data, data destruction processes, data access management, data transformation, and data sharing should be considered. When choosing a data classification methodology, balance usability versus access. You should also accommodate the multiple levels of access and nuances for implementing a secure, but still usable, approach for each level. Always use a defense in depth approach and reduce human access to data and mechanisms for transforming, deleting, or copying data. For example, require users to strongly authenticate to an application, and give the application, rather than the users, the requisite access permission to perform action at a distance. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted network path and require access to the decryption keys. Use tools, such as dashboards and automated reporting, to give users information from the data rather than giving them direct access to the data.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIdentify data types: Identify the types of data that you are storing or processing in your workload.

For example, data classification provides a way to categorize organizational data based on levels of sensitivity, and encryption protects data by way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized access. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.In AWS, the following practices facilitate protection of data:As an AWS customer you maintain full control over your data.AWS makes it easier for you to encrypt your data and manage keys, including regular key rotation, which can be easily automated by AWS or maintained by you.Detailed logging that contains important content, such as file access and changes, is available.AWS has designed storage systems for exceptional resiliency. For example, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard\u2013IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and Amazon Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects.Versioning, which can be part of a larger data lifecycle management process, can protect against accidental overwrites, deletes, and similar harm.AWS never initiates the movement of data between Regions. Content placed in a Region will remain in that Region unless you explicitly enable a feature or leverage a service that provides that functionality.The following questions focus on these considerations for security.AWS provides multiple means for encrypting data at rest and in transit. We build features into our services that make it easier to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for the entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).SEC 7: How do you classify your data?Classification provides a way to categorize data, based on criticality and sensitivity in order to help you determine appropriate protection and retention controls.SEC 8: How do you protect your data at rest?Protect your data at rest by implementing multiple controls, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.SEC 9: How do you protect your data in transit?Protect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss.\n\nKnowledge Area: Implementing policies for data access, lifecycle, and protection\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following practices is a best practice for protecting data in transit?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Integrate access controls with operator and application lifecycle and your centralized federation provider.\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This best practice is for protecting data at rest.\"},{\"answer\": \"Require users to authenticate to an application.\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Requiring users to authenticate to an application and giving the application the requisite access permission to perform action at a distance is an effective way to protect data in transit.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use automated lifecycle policies to enforce lifecycle rules.\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This best practice is for managing the lifecycle of data.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use tools such as dashboards and automated reporting to give users information from the data.\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This best practice is for protecting data at rest.\"}]}", "docs": ["('SUS04-BP03 Use lifecycle policies to delete unnecessary data - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_data_a4.html')", "('SUS 4 How do you take advantage of data access and usage patterns to support your sustainability goals? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-04.html')", "('SEC07-BP04 Define data lifecycle management - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_data_classification_lifecycle_management.html')", "('SEC 8\\xa0 How do you protect your data at rest? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-08.html')", "('SEC03-BP06 Manage access based on lifecycle - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_permissions_lifecycle.html')", "('Data protection - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-dataprot.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A startup wants to host their new web application on AWS.", "domain": "Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine appropriate data security controls", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Rotating encryption keys and renewing certificates", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

The best way to accomplish this is to use a managed service, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). It lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the internet as well as resources on private networks. ACM integrates with AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), AWS distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, also handling automatic certificate renewals. If you use ACM to deploy a private root CA, both certificates and private keys can be provided by it for use in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, and so on.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement secure key and certificate management: Implement your defined secure key and certificate management solution.AWS Certificate ManagerHow to host and manage an entire private certificate infrastructure in AWSImplement secure protocols: Use secure protocols that offer authentication and confidentiality, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec, to reduce the risk of data tampering or loss. Check the AWS documentation for the protocols and security relevant to the services that you are using.Related documents:AWS Documentation\n* For workforce and machine identities that require secrets such as passwords to third-party applications, store them with automatic rotation using the latest industry standards in a specialized service, such as for credentials that are not IAM-related and cannot take advantage of temporary credentials, such as database logins, use a service that is designed to handle management of secrets, such as AWS Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager makes it easy to manage, rotate, and securely store encrypted secrets using supported services. Calls to access the secrets are logged in AWS CloudTrail for auditing purposes, and IAM permissions can grant least-privilege access to them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse AWS Secrets Manager: AWS Secrets Manager is an AWS service that makes it easier for you to manage secrets.

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) helps you manage encryption keys and integrates with many AWS services. This service provides durable, secure, and redundant storage for your AWS KMS keys. You can define your key aliases as well as key-level policies. The policies help you define key administrators as well as key users. Additionally, AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys in the AWS Cloud. It helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement AWS KMS: AWS KMS makes it easy for you to create and manage keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications.

Periodic validation, preferably through an automated tool, is necessary to verify that the correct controls are enforced. For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials. As you are moving from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to centralized identities, you can generate a credential report to audit your IAM users. We also recommend that you enforce MFA settings in your identity provider. You can set up AWS Config Rules to monitor these settings. For machine identities, you should rely on temporary credentials using IAM roles. For situations where this is not possible, frequent auditing and rotating access keys is necessary.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumRegularly audit credentials: Use credential reports, and Identify and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer to audit IAM credentials and permissions.IAM Access AnalyzerGetting credential reportLab: Automated IAM user cleanupUse Access Levels to Review IAM Permissions: To improve the security of your AWS account, regularly review and monitor each of your IAM policies.

A versioning strategy allows your clients to continue using the existing API and migrate their applications to the newer API when they are ready. Deployment can happen anytime, as long as the contract is not violated. The service provider team can use the technology stack of their choice to satisfy the API contract. Similarly, the service consumer can use their own technology.Microservices take the concept of service-oriented architecture (SOA) to the point of creating services that have a minimal set of functionality. Each service publishes an API and design goals, limits, and other considerations for using the service. This establishes a contract with calling applications. This accomplishes three main benefits:The service has a concise business problem to be served and a small team that owns the business problem. This allows for better organizational scaling.The team can deploy at any time as long as they meet their API and other contract requirements.The team can use any technology stack they want to as long as they meet their API and other contract requirements.Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.

Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES. These services remove the need for you to manage a resource, and provide the function of code execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.For more information on Serverless, refer to the Well-Architected Serverless Application Lens whitepaper.Implementation stepsSelect each service to optimize cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis, select each option that provides the best match with your organizational priorities.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n* Managed services shift responsibility for maintaining high-average utilization, and sustainability optimization of the deployed hardware to AWS. Use managed services to distribute the sustainability impact of the service across all tenants of the service, reducing your individual contribution.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowMigrate from self-hosted services to managed services. For example, use managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances instead of maintaining your own Amazon RDS instances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), or use managed container services, such as AWS Fargate, instead of implementing your own container infrastructure.Related documents:AWS FargateAmazon DocumentDBAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)Amazon RedshiftAmazon Relational Database Service (RDS)\n* For workforce and machine identities that require secrets such as passwords to third-party applications, store them with automatic rotation using the latest industry standards in a specialized service, such as for credentials that are not IAM-related and cannot take advantage of temporary credentials, such as database logins, use a service that is designed to handle management of secrets, such as AWS Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager makes it easy to manage, rotate, and securely store encrypted secrets using supported services. Calls to access the secrets are logged in AWS CloudTrail for auditing purposes, and IAM permissions can grant least-privilege access to them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse AWS Secrets Manager: AWS Secrets Manager is an AWS service that makes it easier for you to manage secrets.

Monolithic architecture should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, carefully consider which application components can be broken out into microservices. Depending on your application requirements, this may end up being a combination of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with microservices where possible. Workloads that are capable of statelessness are more capable of being deployed as microservices.Desired outcome: Workloads should be supportable, scalable, and as loosely coupled as possible.When making choices about how to segment your workload, balance the benefits against the complexities. What is right for a new product racing to first launch is different than what a workload built to scale from the start needs. When refactoring an existing monolith, you will need to consider how well the application will support a decomposition towards statelessness. Breaking services into smaller pieces allows small, well-defined teams to develop and manage them. However, smaller services can introduce complexities which include possible increased latency, more complex debugging, and increased operational burden.Common anti-patterns:The microservice Death Star is a situation in which the atomic components become so highly interdependent that a failure of one results in a much larger failure, making the components as rigid and fragile as a monolith.Benefits of establishing this practice:More specific segments lead to greater agility, organizational flexibility, and scalability.Reduced impact of service interruptions.Application components may have different availability requirements, which can be supported by a more atomic segmentation.Well-defined responsibilities for teams supporting the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighChoose your architecture type based on how you will segment your workload. Choose an SOA or microservices architecture (or in some rare cases, a monolithic architecture). Even if you choose to start with a monolith architecture, you must ensure that it\u2019s modular and can ultimately evolve to SOA or microservices as your product scales with user adoption. SOA and microservices offer respectively smaller segmentation, which is preferred as a modern scalable and reliable architecture, but there are trade-offs to consider, especially when deploying a microservice architecture.One primary trade-off is that you now have a distributed compute architecture that can make it harder to achieve user latency requirements and there is additional complexity in the debugging and tracing of user interactions. You can use AWS X-Ray to assist you in solving this problem. Another effect to consider is increased operational complexity as you increase the number of applications that you are managing, which requires the deployment of multiple independency components.Monolithic, service-oriented, and microservices architecturesDetermine the appropriate architecture to refactor or build your application. SOA and microservices offer respectively smaller segmentation, which is preferred as a modern scalable and reliable architecture. SOA can be a good compromise for achieving smaller segmentation while avoiding some of the complexities of microservices. For more details, see Microservice Trade-Offs.If your workload is amenable to it, and your organization can support it, you should use a microservices architecture to achieve the best agility and reliability. For more details, see Implementing Microservices on AWS.Consider following the Strangler Fig pattern to refactor a monolith into smaller components. This involves gradually replacing specific application components with new applications and services. AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces acts as the starting point for incremental refactoring. For more details, see Seamlessly migrate on-premises legacy workloads using a strangler pattern.Implementing microservices may require a service discovery mechanism to allow these distributed services to communicate with each other. AWS App Mesh can be used with service-oriented architectures to provide reliable discovery and access of services. AWS Cloud Map can also be used for dynamic, DNS-based service discovery.If you\u2019re migrating from a monolith to SOA, Amazon MQ can help bridge the gap as a service bus when redesigning legacy applications in the cloud.For existing monoliths with a single, shared database, choose how to reorganize the data into smaller segments. This could be by business unit, access pattern, or data structure. At this point in the refactoring process, you should choose to move forward with a relational or non-relational (NoSQL) type of database.

Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.Best practices\n* The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance.AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your workload needs. You can also find options that are not easily achievable with on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. (For a list of performance efficiency questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution. AWS Solutions Architects, AWS Reference Architectures, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners can help you select an architecture based on industry knowledge, but data obtained through benchmarking or load testing will be required to optimize your architecture.Your architecture will likely combine a number of different architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss the four main resource types to consider (compute, storage, database, and network).PERF 1: How do you select the best performing architecture?Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.\n* Build highly scalable and reliable workloads using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) or a microservices architecture. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the practice of making software components reusable via service interfaces. Microservices architecture goes further to make components smaller and simpler.Best practices\n* The workload has a recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).\n* The Well-Architected Framework identifies a set of general design principles to facilitate good design in the cloud:Stop guessing your capacity needs: If you make a poor capacity decision when deploying a workload, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Automation allows you to create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.Allow for evolutionary architectures: In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, onetime events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to evolve, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.Drive architectures using data: In the cloud, you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.Improve through game days: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.\n* A reliable workload starts with upfront design decisions for both software and infrastructure.

Update deployed components as your needs change.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumEnable horizontal scaling, and use automation to scale out as loads increase and to scale in as loads decrease.Scale using small increments for variable workloads.Align scaling with cyclical utilization patterns (for example, a payroll system with intense bi-weekly processing activities) as load varies over days, weeks, months, or years.Negotiate service level Agreements (SLAs) that allow for a temporary reduction in capacity while automation deploys replacement resources.Related documents:AWS Compute Optimizer DocumentationOperating Lambda: Performance optimizationAuto Scaling Documentation\n* A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in time.Best practices\n* Identify periods of low or no utilization and scale down resources to eliminate excess capacity and improve efficiency.Common anti-patterns:You do not scale your infrastructure with user load.You manually scale your infrastructure all the time.You leave increased capacity after a scaling event instead of scaling back down.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Configuring and testing workload elasticity will help reduce workload environmental impact, save money, and maintain performance benchmarks. You can take advantage of elasticity in the cloud to automatically scale capacity during and after user load spikes to make sure you are only using the exact number of resources needed to meet the needs of your customers.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumElasticity matches the supply of resources you have against the demand for those resources. Instances, containers, and functions provide mechanisms for elasticity, either in combination with automatic scaling or as a feature of the service. Use elasticity in your architecture to ensure that workload can scale down quickly and easily during the period of low user load:Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingUse to verify you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the user load for your application.Application Auto ScalingUse to automatically scale the resources for individual AWS services beyond Amazon EC2, such as Lambda functions or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services.Kubernetes Cluster AutoscalerUse to automatically scale Kubernetes clusters on AWS.Verify that the metrics for scaling up or down are validated against the type of workload being deployed. If you are deploying a video transcoding application, 100% CPU utilization is expected and should not be your primary metric. You can use a customized metric (such as memory utilization) for your scaling policy if required. To choose the right metrics, consider the following guidance for Amazon EC2:The metric should be a valid utilization metric and describe how busy an instance is.The metric value must increase or decrease proportionally to the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group.Use dynamic scaling instead of manual scaling for your Auto Scaling group. We also recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies in your dynamic scaling.Verify that workload deployments can handle both scale-up and scale-down events. Create test scenarios for scale-down events to ensure that the workload behaves as expected. You can use Activity history to test and verify a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group.Evaluate your workload for predictable patterns and proactively scale as you anticipate predicted and planned changes in demand.

To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users. AWS Shield provides automatic protection against these attacks at no extra cost for AWS service endpoints on your workload.

For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are.

Doing so minimizes recovery time by enabling rollback to the previous environment.Common anti-patterns:You perform a mutable deployment by modifying your existing systems. After discovering that the change was unsuccessful, you are forced to modify the systems again to restore the old version extending your time to recovery.During a maintenance window, you decommission the old environment and then start building your new environment. Many hours into the procedure, you discover unrecoverable issues with the deployment. While extremely tired, you are forced to find the previous deployment procedures and start rebuilding the old environment.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By using parallel environments, you can pre-deploy the new environment and transition over to them when desired.

You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.When implementing a scale-out architecture where you want to use multiple instances for service content, you can use load balancers inside your Amazon VPC. AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the ELB service. Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.Common anti-patterns:You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.Benefits of establishing this best practice: A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone, or across multiple Availability Zones. Load balancers feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse the appropriate load balancer for your workload: Select the appropriate load balancer for your workload. If you must load balance HTTP requests, we recommend Application Load Balancer. For network and transport protocols (layer 4 \u2013 TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance and low latency applications, we recommend Network Load Balancer. Application Load Balancers support HTTPS and Network Load Balancers support TLS encryption offloading.Enable offload of HTTPS or TLS encryption: Elastic Load Balancing includes integrated certificate management, user-authentication, and SSL/TLS decryption.

Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.Best practices\n* The workload has a recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).\n* The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance.AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your workload needs. You can also find options that are not easily achievable with on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. (For a list of performance efficiency questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution. AWS Solutions Architects, AWS Reference Architectures, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners can help you select an architecture based on industry knowledge, but data obtained through benchmarking or load testing will be required to optimize your architecture.Your architecture will likely combine a number of different architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss the four main resource types to consider (compute, storage, database, and network).PERF 1: How do you select the best performing architecture?Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.\n* In on-premises environments, customers often have a central team for technology architecture that acts as an overlay to other product or feature teams to ensure they are following best practice. Technology architecture teams typically include a set of roles such as: Technical Architect (infrastructure), Solutions Architect (software), Data Architect, Networking Architect, and Security Architect. Often these teams use TOGAF or the Zachman Framework as part of an enterprise architecture capability.At AWS, we prefer to distribute capabilities into teams rather than having a centralized team with that capability. There are risks when you choose to distribute decision making authority, for example, ensuring that teams are meeting internal standards. We mitigate these risks in two ways. First, we have practices (ways of doing things, process, standards, and accepted norms) that focus on enabling each team to have that capability, and we put in place experts who ensure that teams raise the bar on the standards they need to meet. Second, we implement mechanisms that carry out automated checks to ensure standards are being met.\u201cGood intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen\u201d \u2014 Jeff Bezos.This means replacing a human's best efforts with mechanisms (often automated) that check for compliance with rules or process. This distributed approach is supported by the Amazon leadership principles, and establishes a culture across all roles that works back from the customer. Working backward is a fundamental part of our innovation process. We start with the customer and what they want, and let that define and guide our efforts. Customer-obsessed teams build products in response to a customer need.For architecture, this means that we expect every team to have the capability to create architectures and to follow best practices. To help new teams gain these capabilities or existing teams to raise their bar, we enable access to a virtual community of principal engineers who can review their designs and help them understand what AWS best practices are. The principal engineering community works to make best practices visible and accessible. One way they do this, for example, is through lunchtime talks that focus on applying best practices to real examples. These talks are recorded and can be used as part of onboarding materials for new team members.AWS best practices emerge from our experience running thousands of systems at internet scale. We prefer to use data to define best practice, but we also use subject matter experts, like principal engineers, to set them. As principal engineers see new best practices emerge, they work as a community to ensure that teams follow them. In time, these best practices are formalized into our internal review processes, as well as into mechanisms that enforce compliance. The Well-Architected Framework is the customer-facing implementation of our internal review process, where we have codified our principal engineering thinking across field roles, like Solutions Architecture and internal engineering teams. The Well-Architected Framework is a scalable mechanism that lets you take advantage of these learnings.By following the approach of a principal engineering community with distributed ownership of architecture, we believe that a Well-Architected enterprise architecture can emerge that is driven by customer need. Technology leaders (such as a CTOs or development managers), carrying out Well-Architected reviews across all your workloads will allow you to better understand the risks in your technology portfolio. Using this approach, you can identify themes across teams that your organization could address by mechanisms, training, or lunchtime talks where your principal engineers can share their thinking on specific areas with multiple teams.\n* The Well-Architected Framework identifies a set of general design principles to facilitate good design in the cloud:Stop guessing your capacity needs: If you make a poor capacity decision when deploying a workload, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Automation allows you to create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.Allow for evolutionary architectures: In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, onetime events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to evolve, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.Drive architectures using data: In the cloud, you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.Improve through game days: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.\n\nKnowledge Area: Multi-tier architectures\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best approach for selecting the best performing multi-tier architecture for a workload?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Choose a managed service to provide a fully managed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Although choosing a managed service can help optimize performance, it is not the best approach for selecting the best performing multi-tier architecture for a workload.\"},{\"answer\": \"Follow the Amazon leadership principles.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"The Amazon leadership principles are important for establishing a culture across all roles, but they are not the best approach for selecting the best performing multi-tier architecture for a workload.\"},{\"answer\": \"Distribute decision making authority among teams.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Distributing decision making authority among teams is important for mitigating risks, but it is not the best approach for selecting the best performing multi-tier architecture for a workload.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Using a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture is the best approach for selecting the best performing multi-tier architecture for a workload.\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF 1\\xa0 How do you select the best performing architecture? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-01.html')", "('REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html')", "('Selection - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-sel.html')", "('On architecture - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/on-architecture.html')", "('General design principles - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/general-design-principles.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A large corporation wants to move their on-premises compute to the cloud for increased scalability and security.", "domain": "Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Queuing and messaging concepts (for example, publish/subscribe)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES. These services remove the need for you to manage a resource, and provide the function of code execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.For more information on Serverless, refer to the Well-Architected Serverless Application Lens whitepaper.Implementation stepsSelect each service to optimize cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis, select each option that provides the best match with your organizational priorities.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n* There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:Democratize advanced technologies: Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor. Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting and running a new technology, consider consuming the technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume, allowing your team to focus on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.Go global in minutes: Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.Use serverless architectures: Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.Consider mechanical sympathy: Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n* Using the capabilities of the cloud, you can make frequent changes to your workload implementations.

Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.Best practices\n* Cloud storage is a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information used by your workload. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Select from object, block, and file storage services as well as cloud data migration options for your workload.In AWS, storage is available in three forms: object, block, and file:Object Storage provides a scalable, durable platform to make data accessible from any internet location for user-generated content, active archive, serverless computing, Big Data storage or backup and recovery. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.Block Storage provides highly available, consistent, low-latency block storage for each virtual host and is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by EC2 instances that helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and cost.File Storage provides access to a shared file system across multiple systems. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories. Amazon FSx makes it easy and cost effective to launch and run popular file systems so you can leverage the rich feature sets and fast performance of widely used open source and commercially-licensed file systems.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When you select a storage solution, ensuring that it aligns with your access patterns will be critical to achieving the performance you want.PERF 3: How do you select your storage solution?The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.\n* Evaluate the various characteristics and configuration options and how they relate to storage. Understand where and how to use provisioned IOPS, SSDs, magnetic storage, object storage, archival storage, or ephemeral storage to optimize storage space and performance for your workload.Amazon EBS provides a range of options that allow you to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload. These options are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads, such as databases and boot volumes (performance depends primarily on IOPS), and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads, such as MapReduce and log processing (performance depends primarily on MB/s).SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance provisioned IOPS SSD for latency-sensitive transactional workloads and general-purpose SSD that balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast transfer of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. Transfer acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to route data over an optimized network path. For a workload in an S3 bucket that has intensive GET requests, use Amazon S3 with CloudFront. When uploading large files, use multi-part uploads with multiple parts uploading at the same time to help maximize network throughput.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes: general purpose performance mode, and max I/O performance mode. There are also two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: Bursting Throughput, and Provisioned Throughput. To determine which settings to use for your workload, see the Amazon EFS User Guide.Amazon FSx provides four file systems to choose from: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for enterprise workloads, Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance workloads, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for NetApps popular ONTAP file system, and Amazon FSx for OpenZFS for Linux-based file servers. FSx is SSD-backed and is designed to deliver fast, predictable, scalable, and consistent performance. Amazon FSx file systems deliver sustained high read and write speeds and consistent low latency data access. You can choose the throughput level you need to match your workload\u2019s needs.Common anti-patterns:You only use one storage type, such as Amazon EBS, for all workloads.You use Provisioned IOPS for all workloads without real-world testing against all storage tiers.You assume that all workloads have similar storage access performance requirements.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Evaluating all storage service options can reduce the cost of infrastructure and the effort required to maintain your workloads. It can potentially accelerate your time to market for deploying new services and features.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumDetermine storage characteristics: When you evaluate a storage solution, determine which storage characteristics you require, such as ability to share, file size, cache size, latency, throughput, and persistence of data.

You must automate the ability to recreate necessary infrastructure, redeploy applications, and recreate necessary data for these cases.For example, Amazon EMR launches all nodes for a given cluster in the same Availability Zone because running a cluster in the same zone improves performance of the jobs flows as it provides a higher data access rate. If this component is required for workload resilience, then you must have a way to redeploy the cluster and its data. Also for Amazon EMR, you should provision redundancy in ways other than using Multi-AZ. You can provision multiple nodes. Using EMR File System (EMRFS), data in EMR can be stored in Amazon S3, which in turn can be replicated across multiple Availability Zones or AWS Regions.Similarly, for Amazon Redshift, by default it provisions your cluster in a randomly selected Availability Zone within the AWS Region that you select. All the cluster nodes are provisioned in the same zone.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumImplement self-healing. Deploy your instances or containers using automatic scaling when possible. If you cannot use automatic scaling, use automatic recovery for EC2 instances or implement self-healing automation based on Amazon EC2 or ECS container lifecycle events.Use Auto Scaling groups for instances and container workloads that have no requirements for a single instance IP address, private IP address, Elastic IP address, and instance metadata.What Is EC2 Auto Scaling?Service automatic scalingThe launch template user data can be used to implement automation that can self-heal most workloads.Use automatic recovery of EC2 instances for workloads that require a single instance ID address, private IP address, Elastic IP address, and instance metadata.Recover your instance.Automatic Recovery will send recovery status alerts to a SNS topic as the instance failure is detected.Use EC2 instance lifecycle events or ECS events to automate self-healing where automatic scaling or EC2 recovery cannot be used.EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooksAmazon ECS eventsUse the events to invoke automation that will heal your component according to the process logic you require.Related documents:Amazon ECS eventsEC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooksRecover your instance.Service automatic scalingWhat Is EC2 Auto Scaling?\n* Adopt shared storage and single sources of truth to avoid data duplication and reduce the total storage requirements of your workload. Fetch data from shared storage only as needed. Detach unused volumes to make more resources available.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowMigrate data to shared storage when the data has multiple consumers.Fetch data from shared storage only as needed.Delete data as appropriate for your usage patterns, and implement time-to-live (TTL) functionality to manage cached data.Detach volumes from clients that are not actively using them.Related documents:Amazon FSxCaching strategiesWhat is Amazon Elastic File System?What is Amazon S3?\n* Regularly test failover to your recovery site to ensure proper operation, and that RTO and RPO are met.A pattern to avoid is developing recovery paths that are rarely exercised. For example, you might have a secondary data store that is used for read-only queries. When you write to a data store and the primary fails, you might want to fail over to the secondary data store. If you don\u2019t frequently test this failover, you might find that your assumptions about the capabilities of the secondary data store are incorrect. The capacity of the secondary, which might have been sufficient when you last tested, might be no longer be able to tolerate the load under this scenario. Our experience has shown that the only error recovery that works is the path you test frequently. This is why having a small number of recovery paths is best. You can establish recovery patterns and regularly test them. If you have a complex or critical recovery path, you still need to regularly exercise that failure in production to convince yourself that the recovery path works. In the example we just discussed, you should fail over to the standby regularly, regardless of need.Common anti-patterns:Never exercise failovers in production.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Regularly testing you disaster recovery plan ensures that it will work when it needs to, and that your team knows how to execute the strategy.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEngineer your workloads for recovery. Regularly test your recovery paths Recovery Oriented Computing identifies the characteristics in systems that enhance recovery. These characteristics are: isolation and redundancy, system-wide ability to roll back changes, ability to monitor and determine health, ability to provide diagnostics, automated recovery, modular design, and ability to restart. Exercise the recovery path to ensure that you can accomplish the recovery in the specified time to the specified state.

Update deployed components as your needs change.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumEnable horizontal scaling, and use automation to scale out as loads increase and to scale in as loads decrease.Scale using small increments for variable workloads.Align scaling with cyclical utilization patterns (for example, a payroll system with intense bi-weekly processing activities) as load varies over days, weeks, months, or years.Negotiate service level Agreements (SLAs) that allow for a temporary reduction in capacity while automation deploys replacement resources.Related documents:AWS Compute Optimizer DocumentationOperating Lambda: Performance optimizationAuto Scaling Documentation\n* Runbooks are the predefined procedures to achieve specific outcomes. Use runbooks to perform standard activities, whether done manually or automatically. Examples include deploying a workload, patching a workload, or making DNS modifications.For example, put processes in place to ensure rollback safety during deployments. Ensuring that you can roll back a deployment without any disruption for your customers is critical in making a service reliable.For runbook procedures, start with a valid effective manual process, implement it in code, and trigger it to automatically run where appropriate.Even for sophisticated workloads that are highly automated, runbooks are still useful for running game days or meeting rigorous reporting and auditing requirements.Note that playbooks are used in response to specific incidents, and runbooks are used to achieve specific outcomes. Often, runbooks are for routine activities, while playbooks are used for responding to non-routine events.Common anti-patterns:Performing unplanned changes to configuration in production.Skipping steps in your plan to deploy faster, resulting in a failed deployment.Making changes without testing the reversal of the change.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Effective change planning increases your ability to successfully execute the change because you are aware of all the systems impacted. Validating your change in test environments increases your confidence.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnable consistent and prompt responses to well understood events by documenting procedures in runbooks.AWS Well-Architected Framework: Concepts: RunbookUse the principle of infrastructure as code to define your infrastructure. By using AWS CloudFormation (or a trusted third party) to define your infrastructure, you can use version control software to version and track changes.Use AWS CloudFormation (or a trusted third-party provider) to define your infrastructure.What is AWS CloudFormation?Create templates that are singular and decoupled, using good software design principles.Determine the permissions, templates, and responsible parties for implementation.Controlling access with AWS Identity and Access ManagementUse source control, like AWS CodeCommit or a trusted third-party tool, for version control.What is AWS CodeCommit?Related documents:APN Partner: partners that can help you create automated deployment solutionsAWS Marketplace: products that can be used to automate your deploymentsAWS Well-Architected Framework: Concepts: RunbookWhat is AWS CloudFormation?What is AWS CodeCommit?Related examples:Automating operations with Playbooks and Runbooks\n* Removing the ability for interactive access reduces the risk of human error, and the potential for manual configuration or management. For example, use a change management workflow to deploy Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using infrastructure-as-code, then manage Amazon EC2 instances using tools such as AWS Systems Manager instead of allowing direct access or through a bastion host. AWS Systems Manager can automate a variety of maintenance and deployment tasks, using features including automationworkflows, documents (playbooks), and the run command. AWS CloudFormation stacks build from pipelines and can automate your infrastructure deployment and management tasks without using the AWS Management Console or APIs directly.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowReplace console access: Replace console access (SSH or RDP) to instances with AWS Systems Manager Run Command to automate management tasks.AWS Systems Manager Run CommandRelated documents:AWS Systems ManagerAWS Systems Manager Run CommandReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of Web Application Firewall\n* Existing workloads are regularly reviewed based on for each defined processes.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowTo realize the benefits of new AWS services and features, you must execute the review process on your workloads and implement new services and features as required. For example, you might review your workloads and replace the messaging component with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES). This removes the cost of operating and maintaining a fleet of instances, while providing all the functionality at a reduced cost.Implementation stepsRegularly review the workload: Using your defined process, perform reviews with the frequency specified. Verify that you spend the correct amount of effort on each component. This process would be similar to the initial design process where you selected services for cost optimization. Analyze the services and the benefits they would bring, this time factor in the cost of making the change, not just the long-term benefits.Implement new services: If the outcome of the analysis is to implement changes, first perform a baseline of the workload to know the current cost for each output. Implement the changes, then perform an analysis to confirm the new cost for each output.Related documents:AWS News BlogTypes of Cloud ComputingWhat's New with AWS\n\nKnowledge Area: Workflow orchestration (for example, AWS Step Functions)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What is the best way to automate a workload deployment and management tasks in the cloud?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"Using AWS Systems Manager Run Command\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Systems Manager Run Command is a tool that can automate a variety of maintenance and deployment tasks, using features including automation workflows, documents (playbooks), and the run command.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Using AWS CloudFormation Stacks\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS CloudFormation stacks can be used to automate your infrastructure deployment and management tasks without using the AWS Management Console or APIs directly.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Using interactive console access\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Interactive console access should be replaced with AWS Systems Manager Run Command as it provides a more secure way to update and maintain the workload configuration.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Using runbooks\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Runbooks are used to achieve specific outcomes and are for routine activities, while AWS Systems Manager Run Command is used to automate workload deployment and management tasks.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('SUS05-BP01 Use the minimum amount of hardware to meet your needs - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_hardware_a2.html')", "('REL08-BP01 Use runbooks for standard activities such as deployment - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_tracking_change_management_planned_changemgmt.html')", "('SEC06-BP05 Enable people to perform actions at a distance - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_actions_distance.html')", "('COST10-BP02 Review and analyze this workload regularly - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_evaluate_new_services_review_workload.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A retail company wants to leverage AWS to support their e-commerce platform during peak shopping seasons.", "domain": "Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Designing event-driven, microservice, and/or multi-tier architectures based on requirements", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the practice of making software components reusable via service interfaces. Microservices architecture goes further to make components smaller and simpler.Best practices\n* Service-oriented architecture (SOA) builds services with well-delineated functions defined by business needs. Microservices use domain models and bounded context to limit this further so that each service does just one thing. Focusing on specific functionality enables you to differentiate the reliability requirements of different services, and target investments more specifically. A concise business problem and having a small team associated with each service also enables easier organizational scaling.In designing a microservice architecture, it\u2019s helpful to use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to model the business problem using entities. For example, for the Amazon.com website, entities might include package, delivery, schedule, price, discount, and currency. Then the model is further divided into smaller models using Bounded Context, where entities that share similar features and attributes are grouped together. So, using the Amazon.com example package, delivery, and schedule would be part of the shipping context, while price, discount, and currency are part of the pricing context. With the model divided into contexts, a template for how to boundary microservices emerges.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighDesign your workload based on your business domains and their respective functionality.

Implement software patterns and architectures to minimize the need for customers to replace devices and upgrade equipment. For example, implement new features using code that is backwards compatible with older hardware and operating system versions, or manage the size of payloads so they don\u2019t exceed the storage capacity of the target device.Use software patterns and architectures that best support data access and storage patterns: Understand how data is used within your workload, consumed by your users, transferred, and stored. Select technologies to minimize data processing and storage requirements.SUS 3: How do you take advantage of software and architecture patterns to support your sustainability goals?Implement patterns for performing load smoothing and maintaining consistent high utilization of deployed resources to minimize the resources consumed. Components might become idle from lack of use because of changes in user behavior over time. Revise patterns and architecture to consolidate under-utilized components to increase overall utilization. Retire components that are no longer required. Understand the performance of your workload components, and optimize the components that consume the most resources. Be aware of the devices your customers use to access your services, and implement patterns to minimize the need for device upgrades.\n* The way users consume your workloads and other resources can help you identify improvements to meet sustainability goals. Scale infrastructure to continually match user load and ensure that only the minimum resources required to support users are deployed. Align service levels to customer needs. Position resources to limit the network required for users to consume them. Remove existing, unused assets. Identify created assets that are unused and stop generating them. Provide your team members with devices that support their needs with minimized sustainability impact.Best practices:\n* The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* As changes are made to improve performance, evaluate the collected metrics and data. Use this information to determine impact that the performance improvement had on the workload, the workload\u2019s components, and your customers. This measurement helps you understand the improvements that result from the tradeoff, and helps you determine if any negative side-effects were introduced.A well-architected system uses a combination of performance related strategies. Determine which strategy will have the largest positive impact on a given hotspot or bottleneck. For example, sharding data across multiple relational database systems could improve overall throughput while retaining support for transactions and, within each shard, caching can help to reduce the load.Common anti-patterns:You deploy and manage technologies manually that are available as managed services.You focus on just one component, such as networking, when multiple components could be used to increase performance of the workload.You rely on customer feedback and perceptions as your only benchmark.Benefits of establishing this best practice: For implementing performance strategies, you must select multiple services and features that, taken together, will allow you to meet your workload requirements for performance.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumA well-architected system uses a combination of performance-related strategies.

Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a component from other components that depend on it, increasing resiliency and agility.If changes to one component force other components that rely on it to also change, then they are tightly coupled. Loose coupling breaks this dependency so that dependent components only need to know the versioned and published interface. Implementing loose coupling between dependencies isolates a failure in one from impacting another.Loose coupling enables you to add additional code or features to a component while minimizing risk to components that depend on it. Also, scalability is improved as you can scale out or even change underlying implementation of the dependency.To further improve resiliency through loose coupling, make component interactions asynchronous where possible. This model is suitable for any interaction that does not need an immediate response and where an acknowledgment that a request has been registered will suffice. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them. The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer, such as an SQS queue or a streaming data platform such as Amazon Kinesis, or AWS Step Functions.Figure 4: Dependencies such as queuing systems and load balancers are loosely coupledAmazon SQS queues and Elastic Load Balancers are just two ways to add an intermediate layer for loose coupling. Event-driven architectures can also be built in the AWS Cloud using Amazon EventBridge, which can abstract clients (event producers) from the services they rely on (event consumers). Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is an effective solution when you need high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan out messages to a large number of subscriber endpoints for parallel processing.While queues offer several advantages, in most hard real-time systems, requests older than a threshold time (often seconds) should be considered stale (the client has given up and is no longer waiting for a response), and not processed. This way more recent (and likely still valid requests) can be processed instead.Common anti-patterns:Deploying a singleton as part of a workload.Directly invoking APIs between workload tiers with no capability of failover or asynchronous processing of the request.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a component from other components that depend on it, increasing resiliency and agility. Failure in one component is isolated from others.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighImplement loosely coupled dependencies.

You can also accelerate your time to market when you deploy new services and features.Common anti-patterns:In a post-migration workload, using the same compute solution that was being used on premises.Lacking awareness of the cloud compute solutions and how those solutions might improve your compute performance.Oversizing an existing compute solution to meet scaling or performance requirements, when an alternative compute solution would align to your workload characteristics more precisely.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By identifying the compute requirements and evaluating the available compute solutions, business stakeholders and engineering teams will understand the benefits and limitations of using the selected compute solution. The selected compute solution should fit the workload performance criteria. Key criteria include processing needs, traffic patterns, data access patterns, scaling needs, and latency requirements.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUnderstand the virtualization, containerization, and management solutions that can benefit your workload and meet your performance requirements. A workload can contain multiple types of compute solutions. Each compute solution has differing characteristics. Based on your workload scale and compute requirements, a compute solution can be selected and configured to meet your needs. The cloud architect should learn the advantages and disadvantages of instances, containers, and functions. The following steps will help you through how to select your compute solution to match your workload characteristics and performance requirements.Implementation steps:Select the location of where the compute solution must reside by evaluating PERF05-BP06 Choose your workload\u2019s location based on network requirements. This location will limit the types of compute solution available to you.Identify the type of compute solution that works with the location requirement and application requirementsAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) virtual server instances come in a wide variety of different families and sizes. They offer a wide variety of capabilities, including solid state drives (SSDs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). EC2 instances offer the greatest flexibility on instance choice. When you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware of your instance. Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities. Instance types are grouped in instance families based on these capabilities. Typical use cases include: running enterprise applications, high performance computing (HPC), training and deploying machine learning applications and running cloud native applications.Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to automatically run and manage containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or serverless instances using AWS Fargate. You can use Amazon ECS with other services such as Amazon Route 53, Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon ECS is recommended if your application is containerized and your engineering team prefers Docker containers.Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service. You can choose to run your EKS clusters using AWS Fargate, removing the need to provision and manage servers. Managing Amazon EKS is simplified due to integrations with AWS Services such as Amazon CloudWatch, Auto Scaling Groups, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). When using containers, you must use compute metrics to select the optimal type for your workload, similar to how you use compute metrics to select your EC2 or AWS Fargate instance types. Amazon EKS is recommended if your application is containerized and your engineering team prefers Kubernetes over Docker containers.You can use AWS Lambda to run code that supports the allowed runtime, memory, and CPU options. Simply upload your code, and AWS Lambda will manage everything required to run and scale that code. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly. Lambda is recommended for short running, microservice architectures developed for the cloud.After you have experimented with your new compute solution, plan your migration and validate your performance metrics. This is a continual process, see PERF02-BP04 Determine the required configuration by right-sizing.Level of effort for the implementation plan: If a workload is moving from one compute solution to another, there could be a moderate level of effort involved in refactoring the application.Related documents:Cloud Compute with AWSEC2 Instance TypesProcessor State Control for Your EC2 InstanceEKS Containers: EKS Worker NodesAmazon ECS Containers: Amazon ECS Container InstancesFunctions: Lambda Function ConfigurationPrescriptive Guidance for ContainersPrescriptive Guidance for ServerlessRelated videos:How to choose compute option for startupsOptimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Amazon EC2 foundations (CMP211-R2)Powering next-gen Amazon EC2: Deep dive into the Nitro systemDeliver high-performance ML inference with AWS Inferentia (CMP324-R1)Better, faster, cheaper compute: Cost-optimizing Amazon EC2 (CMP202-R1)Related examples:Migrating the web application to containersRun a Serverless Hello WorldTypeServerContainersFunctionAWS serviceAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)AWS LambdaKey CharacteristicsHas dedicated option for hardware license requirements, Placement Options, and a large selection of different instance families based on compute metricsEasy deployment, consistent environments, runs on top of EC2 instances, ScalableShort runtime (15 minutes or less), maximum memory and CPU are not as high as other services, Managed hardware layer, Scales to millions of concurrent requestsCommon use-casesLift and shift migrations, monolithic application, hybrid environments, enterprise applicationsMicroservices, hybrid environments,Microservices, event-driven applications\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining when to use containers\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Given the scenario, which is the best compute option to minimize costs when batch processing jobs are not running?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"EC2 virtual server instances come with a wide variety of options, but are more expensive compared to other solutions.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Lambda\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Lambda is recommended for short running, microservice architectures developed for the cloud and is cost-efficient.\"},{\"answer\": \"Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"ECS is recommended if your application is containerized and your engineering team prefers Docker containers, but is more expensive compared to other solutions.\"},{\"answer\": \"Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"EKS is recommended if your application is containerized and your engineering team prefers Kubernetes over Docker containers, but is more expensive compared to other solutions.\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF02-BP01 Evaluate the available compute options - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_compute_evaluate_options.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A software development team wants to build and deploy a microservices-based application on AWS.", "domain": "Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Determining when to use serverless technologies and patterns", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting and running a new technology, consider consuming the technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume, allowing your team to focus on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.Go global in minutes: Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.Use serverless architectures: Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.Consider mechanical sympathy: Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost.

Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* Analyze the various performance characteristics of your workload and how these characteristics relate to memory, network, and CPU usage. Use this data to choose resources that best match your workload's profile. For example, a memory-intensive workload, such as a database, could be served best by the r-family of instances. However, a bursting workload can benefit more from an elastic container system.Common anti-patterns:You choose the largest instance available for all workloads.You standardize all instances types to one type for ease of management.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Being familiar with the AWS compute offerings allows you to determine the correct solution for your various workloads. After you have selected the various compute offerings for your workload, you have the agility to quickly experiment with those compute offerings to determine which ones meet the needs of your workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumModify your workload configuration by right sizing: To optimize both performance and overall efficiency, determine which resources your workload needs. Choose memory-optimized instances for systems that require more memory than CPU, or compute-optimized instances for components that do data processing that is not memory-intensive. Right sizing enables your workload to perform as well as possible while only using the required resourcesRelated documents:AWS Compute OptimizerCloud Compute with AWSEC2 Instance TypesECS Containers: Amazon ECS Container InstancesEKS Containers: EKS Worker NodesFunctions: Lambda Function ConfigurationProcessor State Control for Your EC2 InstanceRelated videos:Amazon EC2 foundations (CMP211-R2)Better, faster, cheaper compute: Cost-optimizing Amazon EC2 (CMP202-R1)Deliver high performance ML inference with AWS Inferentia (CMP324-R1)Optimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Powering next-gen Amazon EC2: Deep dive into the Nitro systemHow to choose compute option for startupsOptimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Related examples:Rightsizing with Compute Optimizer and Memory utilization enabledAWS Compute Optimizer Demo code\n* There are four best practice areas for performance efficiency in the cloud:SelectionReviewMonitoringTradeoffsTake a data-driven approach to building a high-performance architecture. Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from the high-level design to the selection and configuration of resource types.Reviewing your choices on a regular basis ensures that you are taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring ensures that you are aware of any deviance from expected performance. Make trade-o\ufb00s in your architecture to improve performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing consistency requirements.\n* Compute resources in your workload require multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal threats. Compute resources include EC2 instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database services, IoT devices, and more.Best practices\n* The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance.AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your workload needs. You can also find options that are not easily achievable with on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. (For a list of performance efficiency questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution. AWS Solutions Architects, AWS Reference Architectures, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners can help you select an architecture based on industry knowledge, but data obtained through benchmarking or load testing will be required to optimize your architecture.Your architecture will likely combine a number of different architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss the four main resource types to consider (compute, storage, database, and network).PERF 1: How do you select the best performing architecture?Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.\n* Cloud technologies are rapidly evolving and you must ensure that workload components are using the latest technologies and approaches to continually improve performance. You must continually evaluate and consider changes to your workload components to ensure you are meeting its performance and cost objectives. New technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), can allow you to reimagine customer experiences and innovate across all of your business workloads.Take advantage of the continual innovation at AWS driven by customer need. We release new Regions, edge locations, services, and features regularly. Any of these releases could positively improve the performance efficiency of your architecture.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.Architectures performing poorly are usually the result of a non-existent or broken performance review process. If your architecture is performing poorly, implementing a performance review process will allow you to apply Deming\u2019s plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle to drive iterative improvement.PERF 6: How do you evolve your workload to take advantage of new releases?When architecting workloads, there are finite options that you can choose from. However, over time, new technologies and approaches become available that could improve the performance of your workload.\n* Optimize resources provided to team members to minimize the sustainability impact while supporting their needs. For example, perform complex operations, such as rendering and compilation, on highly utilized shared cloud desktops instead of on underutilized high-powered single-user systems.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowProvision workstations and other devices to align with how they\u2019re used.Use virtual desktops and application streaming to limit upgrade and device requirements.Move processor or memory-intensive tasks to the cloud.Evaluate the impact of processes and systems on your device lifecycle, and select solutions that minimize the requirement for device replacement while satisfying business requirements.Implement remote management for devices to reduce required business travel.Related documents:What is Amazon WorkSpaces?Amazon AppStream 2.0 DocumentationNICE DCVAWS Systems Manager Fleet ManagerRelated videos:Building Sustainably on AWS\n\nKnowledge Area: Recommending appropriate compute, storage, networking, and database technologies based on requirements\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"When recommending appropriate compute, storage, networking, and database technologies for a financial services company's highly available and secure infrastructure to process financial transactions, which would be the best practice?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Standardize all instance types for ease of management\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Standardizing all instances types for ease of management does not necessarily provide the best performance efficiency for the workload.\"},{\"answer\": \"Choose memory-optimized instances for systems that require more memory than CPU\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Memory-optimized instances are best for systems that require more memory than CPU, while compute-optimized instances are best for components that do data processing that is not memory-intensive.\"},{\"answer\": \"Choose the largest instance available for all workloads\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Choosing the largest instance available for all workloads does not necessarily provide the best performance efficiency for the workload.\"},{\"answer\": \"Perform a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for the architecture\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"A data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for the architecture is the best practice as it allows you to determine the correct solution for your various workloads and optimize performance and overall efficiency.\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF 2\\xa0 How do you select your compute solution? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-02.html')", "('PERF02-BP04 Determine the required configuration by right-sizing - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_compute_right_sizing.html')", "('Definition - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-def.html')", "('SEC 6\\xa0 How do you protect your compute resources? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-06.html')", "('Selection - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-sel.html')", "('Review - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-review.html')", "('SUS02-BP05 Optimize team member resources for activities performed - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_user_a6.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A manufacturing company wants to use AWS to optimize their supply chain and production processes.", "domain": "Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Using purpose-built AWS services for workloads", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n* Managed services shift responsibility for maintaining high-average utilization, and sustainability optimization of the deployed hardware to AWS. Use managed services to distribute the sustainability impact of the service across all tenants of the service, reducing your individual contribution.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowMigrate from self-hosted services to managed services. For example, use managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances instead of maintaining your own Amazon RDS instances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), or use managed container services, such as AWS Fargate, instead of implementing your own container infrastructure.Related documents:AWS FargateAmazon DocumentDBAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)Amazon RedshiftAmazon Relational Database Service (RDS)\n* Use metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost. Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves your data between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on your usage patterns.Implementation stepsConfigure workload metrics: Ensure you capture the key metrics for the workload. These metrics provide an indication of the customer experience, such as the workload output, and align to the differences between resource types and sizes, such as CPU and memory usage.View rightsizing recommendations: Use the rightsizing recommendations in AWS Compute Optimizer to make adjustments to your workload.Select resource type and size automatically based on metrics: Using the workload metrics, manually or automatically select your workload resources. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling or implementing code within your application can reduce the effort required if frequent changes are needed, and it can potentially implement changes sooner than a manual process.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Compute OptimizerAmazon CloudWatch featuresCloudWatch Getting Set UpCloudWatch Publishing Custom MetricsCost Optimization: Amazon EC2 Right SizingGetting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringLaunch an EC2 Instance Using the SDK\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES. These services remove the need for you to manage a resource, and provide the function of code execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.For more information on Serverless, refer to the Well-Architected Serverless Application Lens whitepaper.Implementation stepsSelect each service to optimize cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis, select each option that provides the best match with your organizational priorities.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n\nKnowledge Area: Using purpose-built AWS services for workloads\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which AWS service should the manufacturing company use to reduce their security maintenance tasks and increase their free time to focus on securing their application in other ways?\",\n \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Amazon EC2\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon EC2 is a building-block service and does not manage resources.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Amazon EBS\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon EBS is a building-block service and does not manage resources.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Amazon RDS\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon RDS is a managed service and helps set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Lambda\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Lambda is a managed service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, however it does not manage resources.\"}]}", "docs": ["('COST 5\\xa0 How do you evaluate cost when you select services? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-05.html')", "('SEC06-BP03 Implement managed services - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_implement_managed_services.html')", "('SUS05-BP03 Use managed services - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_hardware_a4.html')", "('COST06-BP03 Select resource type, size, and number automatically based on metrics - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_type_size_number_resources_metrics.html')", "('COST05-BP05 Select components of this workload to optimize cost in line with organization priorities - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_select_service_select_for_cost.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A research institution wants to perform data analysis on a large dataset using AWS compute resources.", "domain": "Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2 :Design highly available and/or fault-tolerant architectures", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions, Amazon Route 53)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

For location failures (such as Availability Zone or AWS Region) ensure that you have systems in place to fail over to healthy resources in unimpaired locations.AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, help distribute load across resources and Availability Zones. Therefore, failure of an individual resource (such as an EC2 instance) or impairment of an Availability Zone can be mitigated by shifting traffic to remaining healthy resources. For multi-region workloads, this is more complicated. For example, cross-region read replicas enable you to deploy your data to multiple AWS Regions, but you still must promote the read replica to primary and point your traffic at it in the event of a failover. Amazon Route 53 and AWS Global Accelerator can help route traffic across AWS Regions.If your workload is using AWS services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB, then they are automatically deployed to multiple Availability Zones. In case of failure, the AWS control plane automatically routes traffic to healthy locations for you. Data is redundantly stored in multiple Availability Zones, and remains available. For Amazon RDS, you must choose Multi-AZ as a configuration option, and then on failure AWS automatically directs traffic to the healthy instance. For Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS tasks, or Amazon EKS pods, you choose which Availability Zones to deploy to. Elastic Load Balancing then provides the solution to detect instances in unhealthy zones and route traffic to the healthy ones. Elastic Load Balancing can even route traffic to components in your on-premises data center.For Multi-Region approaches (which might also include on-premises data centers), Amazon Route 53 provides a way to define internet domains, and assign routing policies that can include health checks to ensure that traffic is routed to healthy regions. Alternately, AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application, then routes to endpoints in AWS Regions of your choosing, using the AWS global network instead of the internet for better performance and reliability.AWS approaches the design of our services with fault recovery in mind. We design services to minimize the time to recover from failures and impact on data. Our services primarily use data stores that acknowledge requests only after they are durably stored across multiple replicas within a Region. These services and resources include Amazon Aurora, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Multi-AZ DB instances, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). They are constructed to use cell-based isolation and use the fault isolation provided by Availability Zones. We use automation extensively in our operational procedures. We also optimize our replace-and-restart functionality to recover quickly from interruptions.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighFail over to healthy resources.

RTO and RPO are your objectives for restoration of your workload. Set these based on business needs. Implement a strategy to meet these objectives, considering locations and function of workload resources and data. The probability of disruption and cost of recovery are also key factors that help to inform the business value of providing disaster recovery for a workload.Best practices\n* Back up data, applications, and configuration to meet your requirements for recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).Best practices\n* Define a disaster recovery (DR) strategy that meets your workload's recovery objectives. Choose a strategy such as: backup and restore; standby (active/passive); or active/active.\n* Regularly test failover to your recovery site to ensure proper operation, and that RTO and RPO are met.A pattern to avoid is developing recovery paths that are rarely exercised. For example, you might have a secondary data store that is used for read-only queries. When you write to a data store and the primary fails, you might want to fail over to the secondary data store. If you don\u2019t frequently test this failover, you might find that your assumptions about the capabilities of the secondary data store are incorrect. The capacity of the secondary, which might have been sufficient when you last tested, might be no longer be able to tolerate the load under this scenario. Our experience has shown that the only error recovery that works is the path you test frequently. This is why having a small number of recovery paths is best. You can establish recovery patterns and regularly test them. If you have a complex or critical recovery path, you still need to regularly exercise that failure in production to convince yourself that the recovery path works. In the example we just discussed, you should fail over to the standby regularly, regardless of need.Common anti-patterns:Never exercise failovers in production.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Regularly testing you disaster recovery plan ensures that it will work when it needs to, and that your team knows how to execute the strategy.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEngineer your workloads for recovery. Regularly test your recovery paths Recovery Oriented Computing identifies the characteristics in systems that enhance recovery.

For example, you might have a secondary data store that is used for read-only queries. When you write to a data store and the primary fails, you might want to fail over to the secondary data store. If you don\u2019t frequently test this failover, you might find that your assumptions about the capabilities of the secondary data store are incorrect. The capacity of the secondary, which might have been sufficient when you last tested, might be no longer be able to tolerate the load under this scenario. Our experience has shown that the only error recovery that works is the path you test frequently. This is why having a small number of recovery paths is best. You can establish recovery patterns and regularly test them. If you have a complex or critical recovery path, you still need to regularly exercise that failure in production to convince yourself that the recovery path works. In the example we just discussed, you should fail over to the standby regularly, regardless of need.Common anti-patterns:Never exercise failovers in production.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Regularly testing you disaster recovery plan ensures that it will work when it needs to, and that your team knows how to execute the strategy.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEngineer your workloads for recovery. Regularly test your recovery paths Recovery Oriented Computing identifies the characteristics in systems that enhance recovery. These characteristics are: isolation and redundancy, system-wide ability to roll back changes, ability to monitor and determine health, ability to provide diagnostics, automated recovery, modular design, and ability to restart.

RTO and RPO are your objectives for restoration of your workload. Set these based on business needs. Implement a strategy to meet these objectives, considering locations and function of workload resources and data. The probability of disruption and cost of recovery are also key factors that help to inform the business value of providing disaster recovery for a workload.Best practices\n* Use AWS or third-party tools to automate system recovery and route traffic to the DR site or Region.Based on configured health checks, AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing and AWS Auto Scaling, can distribute load to healthy Availability Zones while services, such as Amazon Route 53 and AWS Global Accelerator, can route load to healthy AWS Regions. Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller helps you manage and coordinate failover using readiness check and routing control features. These features continually monitor your application\u2019s ability to recover from failures, so you can control application recovery across multiple AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and on premises.For workloads on existing physical or virtual data centers or private clouds, AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery allows organizations to set up an automated disaster recovery strategy in AWS. Elastic Disaster Recovery also supports cross-Region and cross-Availability Zone disaster recovery in AWS.Common anti-patterns:Implementing identical automated failover and failback can cause flapping when a failure occurs.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Automated recovery reduces your recovery time by eliminating the opportunity for manual errors.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumAutomate recovery paths. For short recovery times, follow your disaster recovery plan to get your IT systems back online quickly in the case of a disruption.Use Elastic Disaster Recovery for automated Failover and Failback.

When a change is needed, the architecture is built onto new infrastructure and deployed into production.The most common implementation of the immutable infrastructure paradigm is the immutable server. This means that if a server needs an update or a fix, new servers are deployed instead of updating the ones already in use. So, instead of logging into the server via SSH and updating the software version, every change in the application starts with a software push to the code repository, for example, git push. Since changes are not allowed in immutable infrastructure, you can be sure about the state of the deployed system. Immutable infrastructures are inherently more consistent, reliable, and predictable, and they simplify many aspects of software development and operations.Use a canary or blue/green deployment when deploying applications in immutable infrastructures.Canary deployment is the practice of directing a small number of your customers to the new version, usually running on a single service instance (the canary). You then deeply scrutinize any behavior changes or errors that are generated. You can remove traffic from the canary if you encounter critical problems and send the users back to the previous version. If the deployment is successful, you can continue to deploy at your desired velocity, while monitoring the changes for errors, until you are fully deployed. AWS CodeDeploy can be configured with a deployment configuration that will enable a canary deployment.Blue/green deployment is similar to the canary deployment except that a full fleet of the application is deployed in parallel. You alternate your deployments across the two stacks (blue and green). Once again, you can send traffic to the new version, and fall back to the old version if you see problems with the deployment. Commonly all traffic is switched at once, however you can also use fractions of your traffic to each version to dial up the adoption of the new version using the weighted DNS routing capabilities of Amazon Route 53. AWS CodeDeploy and AWS Elastic Beanstalk can be configured with a deployment configuration that will enable a blue/green deployment.Figure 8: Blue/green deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon Route 53Benefits of immutable infrastructure:Reduction in configuration drifts: By frequently replacing servers from a base, known and version-controlled configuration, the infrastructure is reset to a known state, avoiding configuration drifts.Simplified deployments: Deployments are simplified because they don\u2019t need to support upgrades. Upgrades are just new deployments.Reliable atomic deployments: Deployments either complete successfully, or nothing changes. It gives more trust in the deployment process.Safer deployments with fast rollback and recovery processes: Deployments are safer because the previous working version is not changed. You can roll back to it if errors are detected.Consistent testing and debugging environments: Since all servers use the same image, there are no differences between environments. One build is deployed to multiple environments. It also prevents inconsistent environments and simplifies testing and debugging.Increased scalability: Since servers use a base image, are consistent, and repeatable, automatic scaling is trivial.Simplified toolchain: The toolchain is simplified since you can get rid of configuration management tools managing production software upgrades. No extra tools or agents are installed on servers. Changes are made to the base image, tested, and rolled-out.Increased security: By denying all changes to servers, you can disable SSH on instances and remove keys. This reduces the attack vector, improving your organization\u2019s security posture.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumDeploy using immutable infrastructure. Immutable infrastructure is a model in which no updates, security patches, or configuration changes happen in-place on production systems. If any change is needed, a new version of the architecture is built and deployed into production.Overview of a Blue/Green DeploymentDeploying Serverless Applications GraduallyImmutable Infrastructure: Reliability, consistency and confidence through immutabilityCanaryReleaseRelated documents:CanaryReleaseDeploying Serverless Applications GraduallyImmutable Infrastructure: Reliability, consistency and confidence through immutabilityOverview of a Blue/Green DeploymentThe Amazon Builders' Library: Ensuring rollback safety during deployments\n* Infrastructure protection encompasses control methodologies, such as defense in depth, necessary to meet best practices and organizational or regulatory obligations. Use of these methodologies is critical for successful, ongoing operations in either the cloud or on-premises.In AWS, you can implement stateful and stateless packet inspection, either by using AWS-native technologies or by using partner products and services available through the AWS Marketplace. You should use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private, secured, and scalable environment in which you can define your topology\u2014including gateways, routing tables, and public and private subnets.The following questions focus on these considerations for security.Multiple layers of defense are advisable in any type of environment. In the case of infrastructure protection, many of the concepts and methods are valid across cloud and on-premises models. Enforcing boundary protection, monitoring points of ingress and egress, and comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting are all essential to an effective information security plan.AWS customers are able to tailor, or harden, the configuration of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance, and persist this configuration to an immutable Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Then, whether triggered by Auto Scaling or launched manually, all new virtual servers (instances) launched with this AMI receive the hardened configuration.SEC 5: How do you protect your network resources?Any workload that has some form of network connectivity, whether it\u2019s the internet or a private network, requires multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal network-based threats.SEC 6: How do you protect your compute resources?Compute resources in your workload require multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal threats. Compute resources include EC2 instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database services, IoT devices, and more.\n* Identify and document the workload storage needs and define the storage characteristics of each location. Examples of storage characteristics include: shareable access, file size, growth rate, throughput, IOPS, latency, access patterns, and persistence of data. Use these characteristics to evaluate if block, file, object, or instance storage services are the most efficient solution for your storage needs.\n\nKnowledge Area: Immutable infrastructure\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following deployments is best for minimizing costs when batch processing jobs are not running when using immutable infrastructure?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Canary Deployment\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Canary deployment is the practice of directing a small number of customers to the new version, usually running on a single service instance (the canary).

You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.When implementing a scale-out architecture where you want to use multiple instances for service content, you can use load balancers inside your Amazon VPC. AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the ELB service. Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.Common anti-patterns:You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.Benefits of establishing this best practice: A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone, or across multiple Availability Zones. Load balancers feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse the appropriate load balancer for your workload: Select the appropriate load balancer for your workload. If you must load balance HTTP requests, we recommend Application Load Balancer. For network and transport protocols (layer 4 \u2013 TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance and low latency applications, we recommend Network Load Balancer. Application Load Balancers support HTTPS and Network Load Balancers support TLS encryption offloading.Enable offload of HTTPS or TLS encryption: Elastic Load Balancing includes integrated certificate management, user-authentication, and SSL/TLS decryption. It provides the flexibility to centrally manage TLS settings and offload CPU intensive workloads from your applications. Encrypt all HTTPS traffic as part of your load balancer deployment.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n* These endpoints and the routing to them must be highly available. To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users.

For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Managed services shift responsibility for maintaining high-average utilization, and sustainability optimization of the deployed hardware to AWS. Use managed services to distribute the sustainability impact of the service across all tenants of the service, reducing your individual contribution.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowMigrate from self-hosted services to managed services. For example, use managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances instead of maintaining your own Amazon RDS instances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), or use managed container services, such as AWS Fargate, instead of implementing your own container infrastructure.Related documents:AWS FargateAmazon DocumentDBAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)Amazon RedshiftAmazon Relational Database Service (RDS)\n* These endpoints and the routing to them must be highly available. To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users.

These quotas exist to prevent accidentally provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API operations so as to protect services from abuse. There are also resource constraints, for example, the rate that you can push bits down a fiber-optic cable, or the amount of storage on a physical disk.Best practices\n* You are aware of your default quotas and quota increase requests for your workload architecture. You additionally know which resource constraints, such as disk or network, are potentially impactful.Service Quotas is an AWS service that helps you manage your quotas for over 100 AWS services from one location. Along with looking up the quota values, you can also request and track quota increases from the Service Quotas console or via the AWS SDK. AWS Trusted Advisor offers a service quotas check that displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services. The default service quotas per service are also in the AWS documentation per respective service, for example, see Amazon VPC Quotas. Rate limits on throttled APIs are set within the API Gateway itself by configuring a usage plan. Other limits that are set as configuration on their respective services include Provisioned IOPS, RDS storage allocated, and EBS volume allocations. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) has its own service limits dashboard that can help you manage your instance, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and Elastic IP address limits. If you have a use case where service quotas impact your application\u2019s performance and they are not adjustable to your needs, then contact AWS Support to see if there are mitigations.Common anti-patterns:Deploying a workload with no regard of the service quotas on the AWS services used.Designing a workload without investigating and accommodating for AWS services' design constraints.Deploying a workload with significant use that replaces a known existing workload without configuring the necessary quotas or contacting AWS Support in advance.Planning an event to drive traffic to your workload, but not configuring the necessary quotas or contacting AWS Support in advance.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Being aware of the service quotas, API throttling limits, and design constraints will allow you to account for these in your design, implementation, and operation of the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighReview AWS service quotas in the published documentation and Service QuotasAWS Service Quotas (formerly referred to as limits)Determine all the services your workload requires by looking at the deployment code.Use AWS Config to find all AWS resources used in your AWS accounts.AWS Config Supported AWS Resource Types and Resource RelationshipsYou can also use your AWS CloudFormation to determine your AWS resources used.

Unless otherwise noted, each quota is AWS Region-specific. In addition to the production environments, also manage quotas in all applicable non-production environments, so that testing and development are not hindered.Common anti-patterns:Allowing resource utilization in one isolation zone to grow with no mechanism to maintain capacity in the other ones.Manually setting all quotas independently in isolation zones.Not ensuring Regionally isolated deployments are sized to accommodate the increase in traffic from another Region if a deployment is lost.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Ensuring that you can handle your current load if an isolation zone is unavailable can help reduce the number of errors that occur during failover, instead of causing a denial of service to your customers.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighSelect relevant accounts and Regions based on your service requirements, latency, regulatory, and disaster recovery (DR) requirements.Identify service quotas across all relevant accounts, Regions, and Availability Zones.

Examples of storage characteristics include: shareable access, file size, growth rate, throughput, IOPS, latency, access patterns, and persistence of data. Use these characteristics to evaluate if block, file, object, or instance storage services are the most efficient solution for your storage needs.\n* Evaluate the various characteristics and configuration options and how they relate to storage. Understand where and how to use provisioned IOPS, SSDs, magnetic storage, object storage, archival storage, or ephemeral storage to optimize storage space and performance for your workload.Amazon EBS provides a range of options that allow you to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload. These options are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads, such as databases and boot volumes (performance depends primarily on IOPS), and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads, such as MapReduce and log processing (performance depends primarily on MB/s).SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance provisioned IOPS SSD for latency-sensitive transactional workloads and general-purpose SSD that balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast transfer of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. Transfer acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to route data over an optimized network path. For a workload in an S3 bucket that has intensive GET requests, use Amazon S3 with CloudFront. When uploading large files, use multi-part uploads with multiple parts uploading at the same time to help maximize network throughput.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes: general purpose performance mode, and max I/O performance mode. There are also two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: Bursting Throughput, and Provisioned Throughput. To determine which settings to use for your workload, see the Amazon EFS User Guide.Amazon FSx provides four file systems to choose from: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for enterprise workloads, Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance workloads, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for NetApps popular ONTAP file system, and Amazon FSx for OpenZFS for Linux-based file servers. FSx is SSD-backed and is designed to deliver fast, predictable, scalable, and consistent performance. Amazon FSx file systems deliver sustained high read and write speeds and consistent low latency data access. You can choose the throughput level you need to match your workload\u2019s needs.Common anti-patterns:You only use one storage type, such as Amazon EBS, for all workloads.You use Provisioned IOPS for all workloads without real-world testing against all storage tiers.You assume that all workloads have similar storage access performance requirements.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Evaluating all storage service options can reduce the cost of infrastructure and the effort required to maintain your workloads. It can potentially accelerate your time to market for deploying new services and features.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumDetermine storage characteristics: When you evaluate a storage solution, determine which storage characteristics you require, such as ability to share, file size, cache size, latency, throughput, and persistence of data.

AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves, and provides tools you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization. For any traced request to your application, you can see detailed information not only about the request and response, but also about calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, microservices, databases, and web APIs.What is AWS X-Ray?Debugging with Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics and AWS X-RayRelated documents:Debugging with Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics and AWS X-RayOne Observability WorkshopThe Amazon Builders' Library: Instrumenting distributed systems for operational visibilityUsing Canaries (Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics)What is AWS X-Ray?\n* After you implement your workload, you must monitor its performance so that you can remediate any issues before they impact your customers. Monitoring metrics should be used to raise alarms when thresholds are breached.Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your workload, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events from workloads that run on AWS and on-premises servers. AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications. With AWS X-Ray, you can glean insights into how your application is performing and discover root causes and identify performance bottlenecks. You can use these insights to react quickly and keep your workload running smoothly.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.Ensuring that you do not see false positives is key to an effective monitoring solution. Automated triggers avoid human error and can reduce the time it takes to fix problems. Plan for game days, where simulations are conducted in the production environment, to test your alarm solution and ensure that it correctly recognizes issues.PERF 7: How do you monitor your resources to ensure they are performing?System performance can degrade over time. Monitor system performance to identify degradation and remediate internal or external factors, such as the operating system or application load.\n* Understand and identify areas where increasing the performance of your workload will have a positive impact on efficiency or customer experience. For example, a website that has a large amount of customer interaction can benefit from using edge services to move content delivery closer to customers.Desired outcome: Increase performance efficiency by understanding your architecture, traffic patterns, and data access patterns, and identify your latency and processing times. Identify the potential bottlenecks that might affect the customer experience as the workload grows. When you identify those areas, look at which solution you could deploy to remove those performance concerns.Common anti-patterns:You assume that standard compute metrics such as CPUUtilization or memory pressure are enough to catch performance issues.You only use the default metrics recorded by your selected monitoring software.You only review metrics when there is an issue.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Understanding critical areas of performance helps workload owners monitor KPIs and prioritize high-impact improvements.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighSet up end-to-end tracing to identify traffic patterns, latency, and critical performance areas.

Use tools and automation to test and validate all security controls continuously. For example, scan items such as machine images and infrastructure-as-code templates for security vulnerabilities, irregularities, and drift from an established baseline at each stage. AWS CloudFormation Guard can help you verify that CloudFormation templates are safe, save you time, and reduce the risk of configuration error.Reducing the number of security misconfigurations introduced into a production environment is critical\u2014the more quality control and reduction of defects you can perform in the build process, the better. Design continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to test for security issues whenever possible. CI/CD pipelines offer the opportunity to enhance security at each stage of build and delivery. CI/CD security tooling must also be kept updated to mitigate evolving threats.Track changes to your workload configuration to help with compliance auditing, change management, and investigations that may apply to you. You can use AWS Config to record and evaluate your AWS and third-party resources. It allows you to continuously audit and assess the overall compliance with rules and conformance packs, which are collections of rules with remediation actions.Change tracking should include planned changes, which are part of your organization\u2019s change control process (sometimes referred to as MACD\u2014Move, Add, Change, Delete), unplanned changes, and unexpected changes, such as incidents.

These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the technical aspects of the operation of the service. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it\u2019s possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.Test recovery procedures: In an on-premises environment, testing is often conducted to prove that the workload works in a particular scenario. Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies. In the cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can validate your recovery procedures. You can use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before. This approach exposes failure pathways that you can test and fix before a real failure scenario occurs, thus reducing risk.Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability: Replace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure on the overall workload. Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don\u2019t share a common point of failure.Stop guessing capacity: A common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the capacity of that workload (this is often the objective of denial of service attacks). In the cloud, you can monitor demand and workload utilization, and automate the addition or removal of resources to maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over- or under-provisioning. There are still limits, but some quotas can be controlled and others can be managed (see Manage Service Quotas and Constraints).Manage change in automation: Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation. The changes that need to be managed include changes to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed.\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining automation strategies to ensure infrastructure integrity\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\":\"Which is the best tool to automate the process of patching managed instances with both security-related and other types of updates?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"AWS Systems Manager\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager automates the process of patching managed instances with both security-related and other types of updates.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"AWS CloudFormation\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources, enabling you to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources in an orderly and predictable fashion.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"AWS Config\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.

For location failures (such as Availability Zone or AWS Region) ensure that you have systems in place to fail over to healthy resources in unimpaired locations.AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, help distribute load across resources and Availability Zones. Therefore, failure of an individual resource (such as an EC2 instance) or impairment of an Availability Zone can be mitigated by shifting traffic to remaining healthy resources. For multi-region workloads, this is more complicated. For example, cross-region read replicas enable you to deploy your data to multiple AWS Regions, but you still must promote the read replica to primary and point your traffic at it in the event of a failover. Amazon Route 53 and AWS Global Accelerator can help route traffic across AWS Regions.If your workload is using AWS services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB, then they are automatically deployed to multiple Availability Zones. In case of failure, the AWS control plane automatically routes traffic to healthy locations for you. Data is redundantly stored in multiple Availability Zones, and remains available. For Amazon RDS, you must choose Multi-AZ as a configuration option, and then on failure AWS automatically directs traffic to the healthy instance. For Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS tasks, or Amazon EKS pods, you choose which Availability Zones to deploy to. Elastic Load Balancing then provides the solution to detect instances in unhealthy zones and route traffic to the healthy ones. Elastic Load Balancing can even route traffic to components in your on-premises data center.For Multi-Region approaches (which might also include on-premises data centers), Amazon Route 53 provides a way to define internet domains, and assign routing policies that can include health checks to ensure that traffic is routed to healthy regions. Alternately, AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application, then routes to endpoints in AWS Regions of your choosing, using the AWS global network instead of the internet for better performance and reliability.AWS approaches the design of our services with fault recovery in mind. We design services to minimize the time to recover from failures and impact on data. Our services primarily use data stores that acknowledge requests only after they are durably stored across multiple replicas within a Region. These services and resources include Amazon Aurora, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Multi-AZ DB instances, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). They are constructed to use cell-based isolation and use the fault isolation provided by Availability Zones. We use automation extensively in our operational procedures. We also optimize our replace-and-restart functionality to recover quickly from interruptions.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighFail over to healthy resources.

Validate the effectiveness of KPIs and metrics and revise them if necessary.AWS also has support for third-party log analysis systems and business intelligence tools through the AWS service APIs and SDKs (for example, Grafana, Kibana, and Logstash).Common anti-patterns:The frequency of your deployments has increased with the growth in number of development teams. Your defined expected number of deployments is once per week. You have been regularly deploying daily. When their is an issue with your deployment system, and deployments are not possible, it goes undetected for days.When your business previously provided support only during core business hours from Monday to Friday. You established a next business day response time goal for incidents. You have recently started offering 24x7 support coverage with a two hour response time goal. Your overnight staff are overwhelmed and customers are unhappy. There is no indication that there are issues with incident response times because you are reporting against a next business day target.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By reviewing and revising KPIs and metrics, you understand how your workload supports the achievement of your business outcomes and can identify where improvement is needed to reach business goals.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowValidate the achievement of outcomes and the effectiveness of KPIs and metrics: Create a business level view of your operations activities to help you determine if you are satisfying needs and to identify areas that need improvement to reach business goals.

These metrics will help you to optimize your data management resources, to ensure that your workload requirements are met, and that you have a clear overview on how the workload performs. Use tools, libraries, and systems that record performance measurements related to database performance.There are metrics that are related to the system on which the database is being hosted (for example, CPU, storage, memory, IOPS), and there are metrics for accessing the data itself (for example, transactions per second, queries rates, response times, errors). These metrics should be readily accessible for any support or operational staff, and have sufficient historical record to be able to identify trends, anomalies, and bottlenecks.Desired outcome: To monitor the performance of your database workloads, you must record multiple performance metrics over a period of time. This allows you to detect anomalies as well as measure performance against business metrics to ensure you are meeting your workload needs.Common anti-patterns:You only use manual log file searching for metrics.You only publish metrics to internal tools used by your team and don\u2019t have a comprehensive picture of your workload.You only use the default metrics recorded by your selected monitoring software.You only review metrics when there is an issue.You only monitor system level metrics, not capturing data access or usage metrics.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Establishing a performance baseline helps in understanding normal behavior and requirements of workloads. Abnormal patterns can be identified and debugged faster improving performance and reliability of the database. Database capacity can be configured to ensure optimal cost without compromising performance.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighInability to differentiate out of normal vs. normal performance level will create difficulties in issue identification, and decision making.Potential cost savings may not be identified.Growth patterns will not be identified which might result in reliability or performance degradation.Identify, collect, aggregate, and correlate database-related metrics. Metrics should include both the underlying system that is supporting the database and the database metrics. The underlying system metrics might include CPU utilization, memory, available disk storage, disk I/O, and network inbound and outbound metrics while the database metrics might include transactions per second, top queries, average queries rates, response times, index usage, table locks, query timeouts, and number of connections open. This data is crucial to understand how the workload is performing and how the database solution is used. Use these metrics as part of a data-driven approach to tune and optimize your workload's resources.Implementation steps:Which database metrics are important to track?Monitoring metrics for Amazon RDSMonitoring with Performance InsightsEnhanced monitoringDynamoDB metricsMonitoring DynamoDB DAXMonitoring MemoryDBMonitoring Amazon RedshiftTimeseries metrics and dimensionsCluster level metrics for AuroraMonitoring Amazon KeyspacesMonitoring Amazon NeptuneWould the database monitoring benefit from a machine learning solution that detects operational anomalies performance issues?Amazon DevOps Guru for Amazon RDS provides visibility into performance issues and makes recommendations for corrective actions.Do you need application level details about SQL usage?AWS X-Ray can be instrumented into the application to gain insights and encapsulate all the data points for single query.Do you currently have an approved logging and monitoring solution?Amazon CloudWatch can collect metrics across the resources in your architecture.

The workload architecture of the distributed system must be designed to prevent and mitigate failures. The workload must handle changes in demand or requirements, and it must be designed to detect failure and automatically heal itself.\n* Use frequent, small, and reversible changes to reduce the scope of a change. This results in easier troubleshooting and faster remediation with the option to roll back a change.Common anti-patterns:You deploy a new version of your application quarterly.You frequently make changes to your database schema.You perform manual in-place updates, overwriting existing installations and configurations.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You recognize benefits from development efforts faster by deploying small changes frequently. When the changes are small it is much easier to identify if they have unintended consequences. When the changes are reversible there is less risk to implementing the change as recovery is simplified.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowDeploy frequent, small, reversible changes: Use frequent, small, and reversible changes to reduce the scope of a change. This results in easier troubleshooting and faster remediation with the option to roll back a change.\n* Distributed systems rely on communications networks to interconnect components, such as servers or services. Your workload must operate reliably despite data loss or latency in these networks. Components of the distributed system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or the workload. These best practices prevent failures and improve mean time between failures (MTBF).Best practices\n* After you have designed your workload to be resilient to the stresses of production, testing is the only way to ensure that it will operate as designed, and deliver the resiliency you expect.Best practices\n* Plan to revert to a known good state, or remediate in the production environment if a change does not have the desired outcome. This preparation reduces recovery time through faster responses.Common anti-patterns:You performed a deployment and your application has become unstable but there appear to be active users on the system. You have to decide whether to roll back the change and impact the active users or wait to roll back the change knowing the users may be impacted regardless.After making a routine change, your new environments are accessible but one of your subnets has become unreachable. You have to decide whether to roll back everything or try to fix the inaccessible subnet. While you are making that determination, the subnet remains unreachable.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Having a plan in place reduces the mean time to recover (MTTR) from unsuccessful changes, reducing the impact to your end users.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighPlan for unsuccessful changes: Plan to revert to a known good state (that is, roll back the change), or remediate in the production environment (that is, roll forward the change) if a change does not have the desired outcome. When you identify changes that you cannot roll back if unsuccessful, apply due diligence prior to committing the change.\n* Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.Best practices\n* There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:Automatically recover from failure: By monitoring a workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can trigger automation when a threshold is breached.

Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies. In the cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can validate your recovery procedures. You can use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before. This approach exposes failure pathways that you can test and fix before a real failure scenario occurs, thus reducing risk.Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability: Replace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure on the overall workload. Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don\u2019t share a common point of failure.Stop guessing capacity: A common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the capacity of that workload (this is often the objective of denial of service attacks). In the cloud, you can monitor demand and workload utilization, and automate the addition or removal of resources to maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over- or under-provisioning. There are still limits, but some quotas can be controlled and others can be managed (see Manage Service Quotas and Constraints).Manage change in automation: Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation. The changes that need to be managed include changes to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed.\n* Distributed systems rely on communications networks to interconnect components (such as servers or services). Your workload must operate reliably despite data loss or latency over these networks. Components of the distributed system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or the workload. These best practices enable workloads to withstand stresses or failures, more quickly recover from them, and mitigate the impact of such impairments. The result is improved mean time to recovery (MTTR).Best practices\n* Frequent, small, and reversible changes reduce the scope and impact of a change. This eases troubleshooting, enables faster remediation, and provides the option to roll back a change.Common anti-patterns:You deploy a new version of your application quarterly.You frequently make changes to your database schema.You perform manual in-place updates, overwriting existing installations and configurations.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You recognize benefits from development efforts faster by deploying small changes frequently. When the changes are small, it is much easier to identify if they have unintended consequences. When the changes are reversible, there is less risk to implementing the change as recovery is simplified.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowMake frequent, small, reversible changes: Frequent, small, and reversible changes reduce the scope and impact of a change. This eases troubleshooting, enables faster remediation, and provides the option to roll back a change. It also increases the rate at which you can deliver value to the business.\n* Adopt approaches that provide fast feedback on quality and enable rapid recovery from changes that do not have desired outcomes.

For example, using strategies like caching data to prevent excessive network or database calls, using read-replicas for database engines to improve read rates, sharding or compressing data where possible to reduce data volumes, and buffering and streaming of results as they are available to avoid blocking.As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes.

For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective.Best practices\n* Using the capabilities of the cloud, you can make frequent changes to your workload implementations. Update deployed components as your needs change.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumEnable horizontal scaling, and use automation to scale out as loads increase and to scale in as loads decrease.Scale using small increments for variable workloads.Align scaling with cyclical utilization patterns (for example, a payroll system with intense bi-weekly processing activities) as load varies over days, weeks, months, or years.Negotiate service level Agreements (SLAs) that allow for a temporary reduction in capacity while automation deploys replacement resources.Related documents:AWS Compute Optimizer DocumentationOperating Lambda: Performance optimizationAuto Scaling Documentation\n* As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective. As your requirements change, be aggressive in decommissioning resources, entire services, and systems that you no longer require.Implementing new features or resource types can optimize your workload incrementally, while minimizing the effort required to implement the change. This provides continual improvements in efficiency over time and ensures you remain on the most updated technology to reduce operating costs. You can also replace or add new components to the workload with new services. This can provide significant increases in efficiency, so it's essential to regularly review your workload, and implement new services and features.The following question focuses on these considerations for cost optimization.When regularly reviewing your deployments, assess how newer services can help save you money. For example, Amazon Aurora on RDS can reduce costs for relational databases. Using serverless such as Lambda can remove the need to operate and manage instances to run code.COST 10: How do you evaluate new services?As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective.\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES.

Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves your data between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on your usage patterns.Implementation stepsConfigure workload metrics: Ensure you capture the key metrics for the workload. These metrics provide an indication of the customer experience, such as the workload output, and align to the differences between resource types and sizes, such as CPU and memory usage.View rightsizing recommendations: Use the rightsizing recommendations in AWS Compute Optimizer to make adjustments to your workload.Select resource type and size automatically based on metrics: Using the workload metrics, manually or automatically select your workload resources. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling or implementing code within your application can reduce the effort required if frequent changes are needed, and it can potentially implement changes sooner than a manual process.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Compute OptimizerAmazon CloudWatch featuresCloudWatch Getting Set UpCloudWatch Publishing Custom MetricsCost Optimization: Amazon EC2 Right SizingGetting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringLaunch an EC2 Instance Using the SDK\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components.

The answers must also be action-oriented and not just the name of a service.\n\nScenario:\nA marketing company wants to use AWS to process and analyze large volumes of customer data for targeted advertising campaigns.`\"\n\nContext:\n\n* The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.Best practices\n* Identify and document the workload storage needs and define the storage characteristics of each location. Examples of storage characteristics include: shareable access, file size, growth rate, throughput, IOPS, latency, access patterns, and persistence of data. Use these characteristics to evaluate if block, file, object, or instance storage services are the most efficient solution for your storage needs.\n* Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your workload, and the resources required to use it. Understand your data, and use storage technologies and configurations that best support the business value of the data and how it\u2019s used. Lifecycle data to more efficient, less performant storage when requirements decrease, and delete data that\u2019s no longer required.Best practices:\n* Cloud storage is a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information used by your workload. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Select from object, block, and file storage services as well as cloud data migration options for your workload.In AWS, storage is available in three forms: object, block, and file:Object Storage provides a scalable, durable platform to make data accessible from any internet location for user-generated content, active archive, serverless computing, Big Data storage or backup and recovery. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.Block Storage provides highly available, consistent, low-latency block storage for each virtual host and is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by EC2 instances that helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and cost.File Storage provides access to a shared file system across multiple systems. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories. Amazon FSx makes it easy and cost effective to launch and run popular file systems so you can leverage the rich feature sets and fast performance of widely used open source and commercially-licensed file systems.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When you select a storage solution, ensuring that it aligns with your access patterns will be critical to achieving the performance you want.PERF 3: How do you select your storage solution?The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.\n* Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your workload. For example, Solid State Devices (SSDs) are more energy intensive than magnetic drives and should be used only for active data use cases. Use energy-efficient, archival-class storage for infrequently accessed data.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumMonitor your data access patterns.Migrate data to the appropriate technology based on access pattern.Migrate archival data to storage designed for that purpose.Related documents:Amazon EBS volume typesAmazon EC2 instance storeAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringUsing Amazon S3 storage classesWhat is Amazon CloudWatch?What is Amazon S3 Glacier?Related videos:Architectural Patterns for Data Lakes on AWS\n\nKnowledge Area: Hybrid storage solutions to meet business requirements\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"When selecting a storage solution for the marketing company to process and analyze large volumes of customer data for targeted advertising campaigns, what is the best practice for achieving the desired performance?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"Monitor your data access patterns.\", \"is_correct\": true, \"explanation\": \"Monitoring your data access patterns and selecting the appropriate storage technology based on them are important for achieving the desired performance.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Use Solid State Devices (SSDs).\", \"is_correct\": false, \"explanation\": \"Solid State Devices (SSDs) are more energy intensive than magnetic drives and should be used only for active data use cases.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Migrate data to storage designed for that purpose.\", \"is_correct\": false, \"explanation\": \"Migrating archival data to storage designed for that purpose, such as archival-class storage, is important for infrequently accessed data.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Choose a storage solution that aligns with your access patterns.\", \"is_correct\": true, \"explanation\": \"Ensuring that the storage solution aligns with your access patterns is critical to achieving the desired performance.\"}]\n}", "docs": ["('PERF 3\\xa0 How do you select your storage solution? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/peff-03.html')", "('PERF03-BP01 Understand storage characteristics and requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_right_storage_solution_understand_char.html')", "('SUS 4 How do you take advantage of data access and usage patterns to support your sustainability goals? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-04.html')", "('Storage - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-storage.html')", "('SUS04-BP02 Use technologies that support data access and storage patterns - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_data_a3.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A retail company wants to leverage AWS to support their e-commerce platform during peak shopping seasons.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Determine high-performing and/or scalable storage solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Storage services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic File System [Amazon EFS], Amazon Elastic Block Store [Amazon EBS])", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Understand where and how to use provisioned IOPS, SSDs, magnetic storage, object storage, archival storage, or ephemeral storage to optimize storage space and performance for your workload.Amazon EBS provides a range of options that allow you to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload. These options are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads, such as databases and boot volumes (performance depends primarily on IOPS), and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads, such as MapReduce and log processing (performance depends primarily on MB/s).SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance provisioned IOPS SSD for latency-sensitive transactional workloads and general-purpose SSD that balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast transfer of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. Transfer acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to route data over an optimized network path. For a workload in an S3 bucket that has intensive GET requests, use Amazon S3 with CloudFront. When uploading large files, use multi-part uploads with multiple parts uploading at the same time to help maximize network throughput.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes: general purpose performance mode, and max I/O performance mode. There are also two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: Bursting Throughput, and Provisioned Throughput. To determine which settings to use for your workload, see the Amazon EFS User Guide.Amazon FSx provides four file systems to choose from: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for enterprise workloads, Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance workloads, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for NetApps popular ONTAP file system, and Amazon FSx for OpenZFS for Linux-based file servers. FSx is SSD-backed and is designed to deliver fast, predictable, scalable, and consistent performance.

Scale infrastructure to continually match user load and ensure that only the minimum resources required to support users are deployed. Align service levels to customer needs. Position resources to limit the network required for users to consume them. Remove existing, unused assets. Identify created assets that are unused and stop generating them. Provide your team members with devices that support their needs with minimized sustainability impact.Best practices:\n* Cost efficient agreements and terms ensure the cost of these services scales with the benefits they provide. Select agreements and pricing that scale when they provide additional benefits to your organization.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumWhen you utilize third-party solutions or services in the cloud, it is important that the pricing structures are aligned to Cost Optimization outcomes. Pricing should scale with the outcomes and value it provides. An example of this is software that takes a percentage of savings it provides, the more you save (outcome) the more it charges. Agreements that scale with your bill are typically not aligned to Cost Optimization, unless they provide outcomes for every part of your specific bill. For example, a solution that provides recommendations for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) and charges a percentage of your entire bill will increase if you use other services for which it provides no benefit. Another example is a managed service that is charged at a percentage of the cost of resources that are managed. A larger instance size may not necessarily require more management effort, but will be charged more. Ensure that these service pricing arrangements include a cost optimization program or features in their service to drive efficiency.Implementation stepsAnalyze third-party agreements and terms: Review the pricing in third party agreements. Perform modeling for different levels of your usage, and factor in new costs such as new service usage, or increases in current services due to workload growth. Decide if the additional costs provide the required benefits to your business.Related documents:Accessing Reserved Instance recommendationsInstance purchasing optionsRelated videos:Save up to 90% and run production workloads on Spot\n* To minimize total provisioned storage, create block storage with size allocations that are appropriate for the workload.

When evaluating compute options, be aware of your requirements for workload performance and cost requirements and use this to make informed decisions.In AWS, compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions:Instances are virtualized servers, allowing you to change their capabilities with a button or an API call. Because resource decisions in the cloud aren\u2019t fixed, you can experiment with different server types. At AWS, these virtual server instances come in different families and sizes, and they offer a wide variety of capabilities, including solid-state drives (SSDs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes. AWS Fargate is serverless compute for containers or Amazon EC2 can be used if you need control over the installation, configuration, and management of your compute environment. You can also choose from multiple container orchestration platforms: Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).Functions abstract the execution environment from the code you want to execute. For example, AWS Lambda allows you to execute code without running an instance.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When architecting your use of compute you should take advantage of the elasticity mechanisms available to ensure you have sufficient capacity to sustain performance as demand changes.PERF 2: How do you select your compute solution?The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS compute services with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS Batch, Amazon EMR, Fargate)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"When architecting your use of compute for a disaster recovery plan, what should you consider to ensure sufficient capacity to sustain performance as demand changes?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Using Amazon EC2 for serverless compute to eliminate installation, configuration and management of your compute environment.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon EC2 is a virtualized server, not serverless compute.\"}, \n    {\"answer\": \"Using Amazon EBS to monitor resource decisions in the cloud that aren\u2019t fixed.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon EBS is a block storage service, not a monitoring service.\"}, \n    {\"answer\": \"Using AWS Fargate to take advantage of elasticity mechanisms.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Fargate is a serverless compute service that allows you to take advantage of elasticity mechanisms.\"}, \n    {\"answer\": \"Using Amazon S3 to gain control over the installation configuration and management of your compute environment.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon S3 is a file storage service, not a compute service.\"}]}", "docs": ["('Compute - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-compute.html')", "('COST 5\\xa0 How do you evaluate cost when you select services? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-05.html')", "('SEC06-BP03 Implement managed services - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_implement_managed_services.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A gaming company wants to use AWS to host and scale their multiplayer game servers.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design high-performing and elastic compute solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Distributed computing concepts supported by AWS global infrastructure and edge services", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Use AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as AWS Outposts, AWS Local Zones, and AWS Wavelength, to reduce network latency or improve throughput.The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones. A Region is a physical location in the world having multiple Availability Zones.Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data centerChoose the appropriate Region or Regions for your deployment based on the following key elements:Where your users are located: Choosing a Region close to your workload\u2019s users ensures lower latency when they use the workload.Where your data is located: For data-heavy applications, the major bottleneck in latency is data transfer. Application code should execute as close to the data as possible.Other constraints: Consider constraints such as security and compliance.Amazon EC2 provides placement groups for networking. A placement group is a logical grouping of instances to decrease latency or increase reliability. Using placement groups with supported instance types and an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) enables workloads to participate in a low-latency, 25 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for workloads that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. Using placement groups has the benefit of lowering jitter in network communications.Latency-sensitive services are delivered at the edge using a global network of edge locations. These edge locations commonly provide services such as content delivery network (CDN) and domain name system (DNS). By having these services at the edge, workloads can respond with low latency to requests for content or DNS resolution. These services also provide geographic services such as geo targeting of content (providing different content based on the end users\u2019 location), or latency-based routing to direct end users to the nearest Region (minimum latency).Amazon CloudFront is a global CDN that can be used to accelerate both static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content such as APIs or web applications. It relies on a global network of edge locations that will cache the content and provide high-performance network connectivity to your users. CloudFront also accelerates many other features such as content uploading and dynamic applications, making it a performance addition to all applications serving traffic over the internet. Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that will let you run code closer to users of your workload, which improves performance and reduces latency.Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service. It\u2019s designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to internet applications by translating names, like www.example.com, into numeric IP addresses, like 192.168.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6.AWS Outposts is designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency requirements, where you want that workload to run seamlessly with the rest of your other workloads in AWS. AWS Outposts are fully managed and configurable compute and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware that allow you to run compute and storage on-premises, while seamlessly connecting to the broad array of AWS services in in the cloud.AWS Local Zones is designed to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, like video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications. Local Zones allow you to gain all the benefits of having compute and storage resources closer to end-users.AWS Wavelength is designed to deliver ultra-low latency applications to 5G devices by extending AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to 5G networks. Wavelength embeds storage and compute inside telco providers 5G networks to help your 5G workload if it requires single-digit millisecond latency, such as IoT devices, game streaming, autonomous vehicles, and live media production.Use edge services to reduce latency and to enable content caching. Ensure that you have configured cache control correctly for both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS to gain the most benefit from these approaches.Common anti-patterns:You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.You chose the closest region to your location but not to the workload end user.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You must ensure that your network is available wherever you want to reach customers. Using the AWS private global network ensures that your customers get the lowest latency experience by deploying workloads into the locations nearest them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumReduce latency by selecting the correct locations: Identify where your users and data are located. Take advantage of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations to reduce latency.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n* Distribute workload data and resources across multiple Availability Zones or, where necessary, across AWS Regions. These locations can be as diverse as required.\n* There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:Democratize advanced technologies: Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor. Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting and running a new technology, consider consuming the technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume, allowing your team to focus on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.Go global in minutes: Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.Use serverless architectures: Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.Consider mechanical sympathy: Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.\n\nKnowledge Area: Distributed computing concepts supported by AWS global infrastructure and edge services\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What is the best approach for reducing latency for the gaming company's multiplayer game servers?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Deploy the infrastructure on multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region\",\"is_correct\": \"True\", \"explanation\": \"Deploying the infrastructure on multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region will reduce latency and provide higher availability and performance for the game servers.\"},{\"answer\": \"Deploy the infrastructure on a single Availability Zone in the closest AWS Region\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"Deploying the infrastructure on a single Availability Zone in the closest AWS Region may not be the most optimal design for reducing latency and providing higher availability and performance for the game servers.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Local Zones to deploy the infrastructure\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Local Zones are used to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, such as video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications.

You can also use third-party tools and AWS SDKs to automate scaling.Managed AWS services include Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Auto Scaling, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Route 53.AWS Auto Scaling lets you detect and replace impaired instances. It also lets you build scaling plans for resources including Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, and Amazon Aurora Replicas.When scaling EC2 instances, ensure that you use multiple Availability Zones (preferably at least three) and add or remove capacity to maintain balance across these Availability Zones. ECS tasks or Kubernetes pods (when using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) should also be distributed across multiple Availability Zones.When using AWS Lambda, instances scale automatically. Every time an event notification is received for your function, AWS Lambda quickly locates free capacity within its compute fleet and runs your code up to the allocated concurrency. You need to ensure that the necessary concurrency is configured on the specific Lambda, and in your Service Quotas.Amazon S3 automatically scales to handle high request rates. For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket. There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second.Configure and use Amazon CloudFront or a trusted content delivery network (CDN). A CDN can provide faster end-user response times and can serve requests for content from cache, therefore reducing the need to scale your workload.Common anti-patterns:Implementing Auto Scaling groups for automated healing, but not implementing elasticity.Using automatic scaling to respond to large increases in traffic.Deploying highly stateful applications, eliminating the option of elasticity.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Automation removes the potential for manual error in deploying and decommissioning resources. Automation removes the risk of cost overruns and denial of service due to slow response on needs for deployment or decommissioning.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighConfigure and use AWS Auto Scaling. This monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, you can setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services.What is AWS Auto Scaling?Configure Auto Scaling on your Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, Amazon Aurora Replicas, and AWS Marketplace appliances as applicable.Managing throughput capacity automatically with DynamoDB Auto ScalingUse service API operations to specify the alarms, scaling policies, warm up times, and cool down times.Use Elastic Load Balancing.

The answers must also be action-oriented and not just the name of a service.\n\nScenario:\nA social media platform wants to use AWS to store and process user-generated content.`\"\n\nContext:\n\n* There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:Democratize advanced technologies: Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor. Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting and running a new technology, consider consuming the technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume, allowing your team to focus on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.Go global in minutes: Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.Use serverless architectures: Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.Consider mechanical sympathy: Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES. These services remove the need for you to manage a resource, and provide the function of code execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.For more information on Serverless, refer to the Well-Architected Serverless Application Lens whitepaper.Implementation stepsSelect each service to optimize cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis, select each option that provides the best match with your organizational priorities.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n* Using the capabilities of the cloud, you can make frequent changes to your workload implementations. Update deployed components as your needs change.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumEnable horizontal scaling, and use automation to scale out as loads increase and to scale in as loads decrease.Scale using small increments for variable workloads.Align scaling with cyclical utilization patterns (for example, a payroll system with intense bi-weekly processing activities) as load varies over days, weeks, months, or years.Negotiate service level Agreements (SLAs) that allow for a temporary reduction in capacity while automation deploys replacement resources.Related documents:AWS Compute Optimizer DocumentationOperating Lambda: Performance optimizationAuto Scaling Documentation\n* The workload has a recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).\n* Selecting compute resources that meet your requirements, performance needs, and provide great efficiency of cost and effort will enable you to accomplish more with the same number of resources. When evaluating compute options, be aware of your requirements for workload performance and cost requirements and use this to make informed decisions.In AWS, compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions:Instances are virtualized servers, allowing you to change their capabilities with a button or an API call. Because resource decisions in the cloud aren\u2019t fixed, you can experiment with different server types. At AWS, these virtual server instances come in different families and sizes, and they offer a wide variety of capabilities, including solid-state drives (SSDs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes. AWS Fargate is serverless compute for containers or Amazon EC2 can be used if you need control over the installation, configuration, and management of your compute environment. You can also choose from multiple container orchestration platforms: Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).Functions abstract the execution environment from the code you want to execute. For example, AWS Lambda allows you to execute code without running an instance.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When architecting your use of compute you should take advantage of the elasticity mechanisms available to ensure you have sufficient capacity to sustain performance as demand changes.PERF 2: How do you select your compute solution?The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance.

The answers must also be action-oriented and not just the name of a service.\n\nScenario:\nA software development team wants to build and deploy a microservices-based application on AWS.`\"\n\nContext:\n\n* Workload segmentation is important when determining the resilience requirements of your application. Monolithic architecture should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, carefully consider which application components can be broken out into microservices. Depending on your application requirements, this may end up being a combination of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with microservices where possible. Workloads that are capable of statelessness are more capable of being deployed as microservices.Desired outcome: Workloads should be supportable, scalable, and as loosely coupled as possible.When making choices about how to segment your workload, balance the benefits against the complexities. What is right for a new product racing to first launch is different than what a workload built to scale from the start needs. When refactoring an existing monolith, you will need to consider how well the application will support a decomposition towards statelessness. Breaking services into smaller pieces allows small, well-defined teams to develop and manage them. However, smaller services can introduce complexities which include possible increased latency, more complex debugging, and increased operational burden.Common anti-patterns:The microservice Death Star is a situation in which the atomic components become so highly interdependent that a failure of one results in a much larger failure, making the components as rigid and fragile as a monolith.Benefits of establishing this practice:More specific segments lead to greater agility, organizational flexibility, and scalability.Reduced impact of service interruptions.Application components may have different availability requirements, which can be supported by a more atomic segmentation.Well-defined responsibilities for teams supporting the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighChoose your architecture type based on how you will segment your workload. Choose an SOA or microservices architecture (or in some rare cases, a monolithic architecture). Even if you choose to start with a monolith architecture, you must ensure that it\u2019s modular and can ultimately evolve to SOA or microservices as your product scales with user adoption. SOA and microservices offer respectively smaller segmentation, which is preferred as a modern scalable and reliable architecture, but there are trade-offs to consider, especially when deploying a microservice architecture.One primary trade-off is that you now have a distributed compute architecture that can make it harder to achieve user latency requirements and there is additional complexity in the debugging and tracing of user interactions. You can use AWS X-Ray to assist you in solving this problem. Another effect to consider is increased operational complexity as you increase the number of applications that you are managing, which requires the deployment of multiple independency components.Monolithic, service-oriented, and microservices architecturesDetermine the appropriate architecture to refactor or build your application. SOA and microservices offer respectively smaller segmentation, which is preferred as a modern scalable and reliable architecture. SOA can be a good compromise for achieving smaller segmentation while avoiding some of the complexities of microservices. For more details, see Microservice Trade-Offs.If your workload is amenable to it, and your organization can support it, you should use a microservices architecture to achieve the best agility and reliability. For more details, see Implementing Microservices on AWS.Consider following the Strangler Fig pattern to refactor a monolith into smaller components. This involves gradually replacing specific application components with new applications and services. AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces acts as the starting point for incremental refactoring. For more details, see Seamlessly migrate on-premises legacy workloads using a strangler pattern.Implementing microservices may require a service discovery mechanism to allow these distributed services to communicate with each other. AWS App Mesh can be used with service-oriented architectures to provide reliable discovery and access of services. AWS Cloud Map can also be used for dynamic, DNS-based service discovery.If you\u2019re migrating from a monolith to SOA, Amazon MQ can help bridge the gap as a service bus when redesigning legacy applications in the cloud.For existing monoliths with a single, shared database, choose how to reorganize the data into smaller segments. This could be by business unit, access pattern, or data structure. At this point in the refactoring process, you should choose to move forward with a relational or non-relational (NoSQL) type of database.

You can take advantage of elasticity in the cloud to automatically scale capacity during and after user load spikes to make sure you are only using the exact number of resources needed to meet the needs of your customers.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumElasticity matches the supply of resources you have against the demand for those resources. Instances, containers, and functions provide mechanisms for elasticity, either in combination with automatic scaling or as a feature of the service. Use elasticity in your architecture to ensure that workload can scale down quickly and easily during the period of low user load:Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingUse to verify you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the user load for your application.Application Auto ScalingUse to automatically scale the resources for individual AWS services beyond Amazon EC2, such as Lambda functions or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services.Kubernetes Cluster AutoscalerUse to automatically scale Kubernetes clusters on AWS.Verify that the metrics for scaling up or down are validated against the type of workload being deployed. If you are deploying a video transcoding application, 100% CPU utilization is expected and should not be your primary metric. You can use a customized metric (such as memory utilization) for your scaling policy if required. To choose the right metrics, consider the following guidance for Amazon EC2:The metric should be a valid utilization metric and describe how busy an instance is.The metric value must increase or decrease proportionally to the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group.Use dynamic scaling instead of manual scaling for your Auto Scaling group. We also recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies in your dynamic scaling.Verify that workload deployments can handle both scale-up and scale-down events. Create test scenarios for scale-down events to ensure that the workload behaves as expected. You can use Activity history to test and verify a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group.Evaluate your workload for predictable patterns and proactively scale as you anticipate predicted and planned changes in demand. Use Predictive Scaling with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to eliminate the need to overprove capacity.Related documents:Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingPredictive Scaling for EC2, Powered by Machine LearningAnalyze user behavior using Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and KibanaWhat is Amazon CloudWatch?What is AWS X-Ray?VPC Flow LogsMonitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon RDSIntroducing Native Support for Predictive Scaling with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingHow to create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy based on a memory utilization metric (Linux)Introducing Karpenter - An Open-Source, High-Performance Kubernetes Cluster AutoscalerRelated videos:Better, faster, cheaper compute: Cost-optimizing Amazon EC2 (CMP202-R1)Related examples:Lab: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group ExamplesLab: Implement Autoscaling with KarpenterAuto-scaling mechanismWhere to useAmazon EC2 Auto ScalingUse to verify you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the user load for your application.Application Auto ScalingUse to automatically scale the resources for individual AWS services beyond Amazon EC2, such as Lambda functions or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services.Kubernetes Cluster AutoscalerUse to automatically scale Kubernetes clusters on AWS.\n* Use metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost. Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering.

You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.Best practices\n* Use metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost. Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering.

Use AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as AWS Outposts, AWS Local Zones, and AWS Wavelength, to reduce network latency or improve throughput.The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones. A Region is a physical location in the world having multiple Availability Zones.Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data centerChoose the appropriate Region or Regions for your deployment based on the following key elements:Where your users are located: Choosing a Region close to your workload\u2019s users ensures lower latency when they use the workload.Where your data is located: For data-heavy applications, the major bottleneck in latency is data transfer. Application code should execute as close to the data as possible.Other constraints: Consider constraints such as security and compliance.Amazon EC2 provides placement groups for networking. A placement group is a logical grouping of instances to decrease latency or increase reliability. Using placement groups with supported instance types and an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) enables workloads to participate in a low-latency, 25 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for workloads that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. Using placement groups has the benefit of lowering jitter in network communications.Latency-sensitive services are delivered at the edge using a global network of edge locations. These edge locations commonly provide services such as content delivery network (CDN) and domain name system (DNS). By having these services at the edge, workloads can respond with low latency to requests for content or DNS resolution. These services also provide geographic services such as geo targeting of content (providing different content based on the end users\u2019 location), or latency-based routing to direct end users to the nearest Region (minimum latency).Amazon CloudFront is a global CDN that can be used to accelerate both static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content such as APIs or web applications. It relies on a global network of edge locations that will cache the content and provide high-performance network connectivity to your users. CloudFront also accelerates many other features such as content uploading and dynamic applications, making it a performance addition to all applications serving traffic over the internet. Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that will let you run code closer to users of your workload, which improves performance and reduces latency.Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service. It\u2019s designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to internet applications by translating names, like www.example.com, into numeric IP addresses, like 192.168.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6.AWS Outposts is designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency requirements, where you want that workload to run seamlessly with the rest of your other workloads in AWS. AWS Outposts are fully managed and configurable compute and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware that allow you to run compute and storage on-premises, while seamlessly connecting to the broad array of AWS services in in the cloud.AWS Local Zones is designed to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, like video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications. Local Zones allow you to gain all the benefits of having compute and storage resources closer to end-users.AWS Wavelength is designed to deliver ultra-low latency applications to 5G devices by extending AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to 5G networks. Wavelength embeds storage and compute inside telco providers 5G networks to help your 5G workload if it requires single-digit millisecond latency, such as IoT devices, game streaming, autonomous vehicles, and live media production.Use edge services to reduce latency and to enable content caching. Ensure that you have configured cache control correctly for both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS to gain the most benefit from these approaches.Common anti-patterns:You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.You chose the closest region to your location but not to the workload end user.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You must ensure that your network is available wherever you want to reach customers. Using the AWS private global network ensures that your customers get the lowest latency experience by deploying workloads into the locations nearest them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumReduce latency by selecting the correct locations: Identify where your users and data are located. Take advantage of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations to reduce latency.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which AWS feature should an organization use to reduce network latency for a new web application hosted on AWS?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Route 53 to translate names into numeric IP addresses\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service, not a feature to reduce network latency\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Regions and Availability Zones to deploy the application close to the users\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Regions and Availability Zones offer the ability to reduce network latency by deploying the application close to the users\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Outposts to embed storage and compute inside telco providers' 5G networks\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Outposts is designed to remain on-premises due to latency requirements, not inside telco providers' 5G networks\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Use Amazon CloudFront to accelerate content and dynamic applications\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"CloudFront is a global CDN that can be used to accelerate content, but not to reduce network latency\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF05-BP06 Choose your workload\u2019s location based on network requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_network_location.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to build a mobile application that needs to access and store data in the cloud.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine high-performing database solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Caching strategies and services (for example, Amazon ElastiCache)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level\u2013not the infrastructure or operating system.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumExplore available services: Explore, test, and implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS.Related documents:AWS WebsiteAWS Systems ManagerReplacing a Bastion Host with Amazon EC2 Systems ManagerSecurity Overview of AWS LambdaRelated videos:Running high-security workloads on Amazon EKSSecuring Serverless and Container ServicesSecurity best practices for the Amazon EC2 instance metadata serviceRelated examples:Lab: AWS Certificate Manager Request Public Certificate\n\nKnowledge Area: Caching strategies and services (for example, Amazon ElastiCache)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best caching strategy to use for the mobile application that needs to access and store data in the cloud?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Host the application on Amazon EC2 and store data on Amazon S3\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This would not provide any caching to improve performance of the application\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Implement Amazon ElastiCache to cache frequently accessed data\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Amazon ElastiCache is a managed caching service which could be used to improve performance of the application by caching frequently accessed data\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Implement Amazon DynamoDB to store data and cache it on the application's servers\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This would not provide any caching to improve performance of the application\"},\n{\"answer\": \"Host the application on Amazon ECS and store data on Amazon EBS\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This would not provide any caching to improve performance of the application\"}]}", "docs": ["('COST 5\\xa0 How do you evaluate cost when you select services? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-05.html')", "('SEC06-BP03 Implement managed services - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_protect_compute_implement_managed_services.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A financial services company wants to run a highly available and secure infrastructure to process financial transactions.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine high-performing database solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Data access patterns (for example, read-intensive compared with write-intensive)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries. Considerations around highly specialized query functionality for text and natural language processing, time series, and graphs must also be taken into account.Desired outcome: The data storage has been selected based on identified and documented data access patterns. This might include the most common read, write and delete queries, the need for ad-hoc calculations and aggregations, complexity of the data, the data interdependency, and the required consistency needs.Common anti-patterns:You only select one database vendor to simplify operations management.You assume that data access patterns will stay consistent over time.You implement complex transactions, rollback, and consistency logic in the application.The database is configured to support a potential high traffic burst, which results in the database resources remaining idle most of the time.Using a shared database for transactional and analytical uses.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and optimizing your data storage based on access patterns will help decrease development complexity and optimize your performance opportunities. Understanding when to use read replicas, global tables, data partitioning, and caching will help you decrease operational overhead and scale based on your workload needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumIdentify and evaluate your data access pattern to select the correct storage configuration. Each database solution has options to configure and optimize your storage solution. Use the collected metrics and logs and experiment with options to find the optimal configuration. Use the following table to review storage options per database service.Implementation steps:Identify and document the anticipated growth of the data and traffic.Amazon RDS and Aurora support storage automatic scaling up to documented limits. Beyond this, consider transitioning older data to Amazon S3 for archival, aggregating historical data for analytics or scaling horizontally via sharding.DynamoDB and Amazon S3 will scale to near limitless storage volume automatically.Amazon RDS instances and databases running on EC2 can be manually resized and EC2 instances can have new EBS volumes added at a later date for additional storage.Instance types can be changed based on changes in activity. For example, you can start with a smaller instance while you are testing, then scale the instance as you begin to receive production traffic to the service. Aurora Serverless V2 automatically scales in response to changes in load.Document requirements around normal and peak performance (transactions per second TPS and queries per second QPS) and consistency (ACID and eventual consistency).Document solution deployment aspects and the database access requirements (global, Mult-AZ, read replication, multiple write nodes)Level of effort for the implementation plan: If you do not have logs or metrics for your data management solution, you will need to complete that before identifying and documenting your data access patterns. Once your data access pattern is understood, selecting, and configuring your data storage is a low level of effort.Related documents:AWS Database CachingAmazon Athena top 10 performance tipsAmazon Aurora best practicesAmazon DynamoDB AcceleratorAmazon DynamoDB best practicesAmazon Redshift Spectrum best practicesAmazon Redshift performanceCloud Databases with AWSAmazon RDS Storage TypesRelated videos:AWS purpose-built databases (DAT209-L)Amazon Aurora storage demystified: How it all works (DAT309-R)Amazon DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns (DAT403-R1)Related examples:Experiment and test with Distributed Load Testing on AWSAWS ServicesAmazon RDS, Amazon AuroraAmazon DynamoDBAmazon DocumentDBAmazon ElastiCacheAmazon NeptuneAmazon TimestreamAmazon KeyspacesAmazon QLDBScaling StorageStorage automatic scaling option available to automatically scale provisioned storage IOPS can also be scaled independently of provisioned storage when leveraging provisioned IOPs storage typesAutomatically scales.

Tables are unconstrained in terms of size.\n* Use performance characteristics and access patterns that optimize how data is stored or queried to achieve the best possible performance. Measure how optimizations such as indexing, key distribution, data warehouse design, or caching strategies impact system performance or overall efficiency.Common anti-patterns:You only use manual log file searching for metrics.You only publish metrics to internal tools.Benefits of establishing this best practice: In order to ensure you are meeting the metrics required for the workload, you must monitor database performance metrics related to both reads and writes.

In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries. Considerations around highly specialized query functionality for text and natural language processing, time series, and graphs must also be taken into account.Desired outcome: The data storage has been selected based on identified and documented data access patterns. This might include the most common read, write and delete queries, the need for ad-hoc calculations and aggregations, complexity of the data, the data interdependency, and the required consistency needs.Common anti-patterns:You only select one database vendor to simplify operations management.You assume that data access patterns will stay consistent over time.You implement complex transactions, rollback, and consistency logic in the application.The database is configured to support a potential high traffic burst, which results in the database resources remaining idle most of the time.Using a shared database for transactional and analytical uses.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and optimizing your data storage based on access patterns will help decrease development complexity and optimize your performance opportunities.

For workloads with extreme resilience requirements, carefully evaluate the options for a multi-Region architecture.\n* Implement services to reduce data transfer. For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery. Also look for caching services where there is repeated access to data, or large amounts of data.Related documents:AWS Direct ConnectAWS Explore Our ProductsAWS caching solutionsAmazon CloudFrontDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n\nKnowledge Area: Database connections and proxies\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which AWS service should be used to establish a secure and private connection between the software development team's private network and the AWS global network?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Amazon CloudFront\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds.\"}, \n    {\"answer\": \"AWS Direct Connect\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"VPC Endpoints\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"AWS VPN\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network.\"}\n]\n}", "docs": ["('REL10-BP02 Select the appropriate locations for your multi-location deployment - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_fault_isolation_select_location.html')", "('COST08-BP03 Implement services to reduce data transfer costs - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_data_transfer_implement_services.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A manufacturing company wants to use AWS to optimize their supply chain and production processes.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Determine high-performing database solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Database engines with appropriate use cases (for example, heterogeneous migrations, homogeneous migrations)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

RTO and RPO are your objectives for restoration of your workload. Set these based on business needs. Implement a strategy to meet these objectives, considering locations and function of workload resources and data. The probability of disruption and cost of recovery are also key factors that help to inform the business value of providing disaster recovery for a workload.Best practices\n* If components of the workload can only run in a single Availability Zone or in an on-premises data center, you must implement the capability to do a complete rebuild of the workload within your defined recovery objectives.If the best practice to deploy the workload to multiple locations is not possible due to technological constraints, you must implement an alternate path to resiliency. You must automate the ability to recreate necessary infrastructure, redeploy applications, and recreate necessary data for these cases.For example, Amazon EMR launches all nodes for a given cluster in the same Availability Zone because running a cluster in the same zone improves performance of the jobs flows as it provides a higher data access rate. If this component is required for workload resilience, then you must have a way to redeploy the cluster and its data. Also for Amazon EMR, you should provision redundancy in ways other than using Multi-AZ. You can provision multiple nodes. Using EMR File System (EMRFS), data in EMR can be stored in Amazon S3, which in turn can be replicated across multiple Availability Zones or AWS Regions.Similarly, for Amazon Redshift, by default it provisions your cluster in a randomly selected Availability Zone within the AWS Region that you select. All the cluster nodes are provisioned in the same zone.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumImplement self-healing. Deploy your instances or containers using automatic scaling when possible. If you cannot use automatic scaling, use automatic recovery for EC2 instances or implement self-healing automation based on Amazon EC2 or ECS container lifecycle events.Use Auto Scaling groups for instances and container workloads that have no requirements for a single instance IP address, private IP address, Elastic IP address, and instance metadata.What Is EC2 Auto Scaling?Service automatic scalingThe launch template user data can be used to implement automation that can self-heal most workloads.Use automatic recovery of EC2 instances for workloads that require a single instance ID address, private IP address, Elastic IP address, and instance metadata.Recover your instance.Automatic Recovery will send recovery status alerts to a SNS topic as the instance failure is detected.Use EC2 instance lifecycle events or ECS events to automate self-healing where automatic scaling or EC2 recovery cannot be used.EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooksAmazon ECS eventsUse the events to invoke automation that will heal your component according to the process logic you require.Related documents:Amazon ECS eventsEC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooksRecover your instance.Service automatic scalingWhat Is EC2 Auto Scaling?\n* Back up data, applications, and configuration to meet your requirements for recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).Best practices\n* A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in time.Best practices\n* When you architect solutions, think about tradeoffs to ensure an optimal approach. Depending on your situation, you could trade consistency, durability, and space for time or latency, to deliver higher performance.Using AWS, you can go global in minutes and deploy resources in multiple locations across the globe to be closer to your end users. You can also dynamically add readonly replicas to information stores (such as database systems) to reduce the load on the primary database.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes. Measure the impacts to the system and to the end-user to understand how your trade-o\ufb00s impact your workload. Use a systematic approach, such as load testing, to explore whether the tradeoff improves performance.PERF 8: How do you use tradeoffs to improve performance?When architecting solutions, determining tradeoffs enables you to select an optimal approach. Often you can improve performance by trading consistency, durability, and space for time and latency.\n* Where applicable, use multiple strategies to improve performance. For example, using strategies like caching data to prevent excessive network or database calls, using read-replicas for database engines to improve read rates, sharding or compressing data where possible to reduce data volumes, and buffering and streaming of results as they are available to avoid blocking.As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes. Measure the impacts to the system and to the end-user to understand how your trade-offs impact your workload. Use a systematic approach, such as load testing, to explore whether the tradeoff improves performance.Common anti-patterns:You assume that workload performance is adequate if customers are not complaining.You only collect data on performance after you have made performance-related changes.Benefits of establishing this best practice: To optimize performance and resource utilization, you need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and historical reference. You can create dashboards and perform metric math on your data to derive operational and utilization insights for your workloads as they change over time.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowUse a data-driven approach to evolve your architecture: As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes.

Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance.AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your workload needs. You can also find options that are not easily achievable with on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. (For a list of performance efficiency questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution. AWS Solutions Architects, AWS Reference Architectures, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners can help you select an architecture based on industry knowledge, but data obtained through benchmarking or load testing will be required to optimize your architecture.Your architecture will likely combine a number of different architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss the four main resource types to consider (compute, storage, database, and network).PERF 1: How do you select the best performing architecture?Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.\n* Use the access patterns of the workload to decide which services and technologies to use. In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries. Considerations around highly specialized query functionality for text and natural language processing, time series, and graphs must also be taken into account.Desired outcome: The data storage has been selected based on identified and documented data access patterns. This might include the most common read, write and delete queries, the need for ad-hoc calculations and aggregations, complexity of the data, the data interdependency, and the required consistency needs.Common anti-patterns:You only select one database vendor to simplify operations management.You assume that data access patterns will stay consistent over time.You implement complex transactions, rollback, and consistency logic in the application.The database is configured to support a potential high traffic burst, which results in the database resources remaining idle most of the time.Using a shared database for transactional and analytical uses.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and optimizing your data storage based on access patterns will help decrease development complexity and optimize your performance opportunities. Understanding when to use read replicas, global tables, data partitioning, and caching will help you decrease operational overhead and scale based on your workload needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumIdentify and evaluate your data access pattern to select the correct storage configuration. Each database solution has options to configure and optimize your storage solution. Use the collected metrics and logs and experiment with options to find the optimal configuration.

This might include the most common read, write and delete queries, the need for ad-hoc calculations and aggregations, complexity of the data, the data interdependency, and the required consistency needs.Common anti-patterns:You only select one database vendor to simplify operations management.You assume that data access patterns will stay consistent over time.You implement complex transactions, rollback, and consistency logic in the application.The database is configured to support a potential high traffic burst, which results in the database resources remaining idle most of the time.Using a shared database for transactional and analytical uses.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and optimizing your data storage based on access patterns will help decrease development complexity and optimize your performance opportunities. Understanding when to use read replicas, global tables, data partitioning, and caching will help you decrease operational overhead and scale based on your workload needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumIdentify and evaluate your data access pattern to select the correct storage configuration. Each database solution has options to configure and optimize your storage solution. Use the collected metrics and logs and experiment with options to find the optimal configuration. Use the following table to review storage options per database service.Implementation steps:Identify and document the anticipated growth of the data and traffic.Amazon RDS and Aurora support storage automatic scaling up to documented limits. Beyond this, consider transitioning older data to Amazon S3 for archival, aggregating historical data for analytics or scaling horizontally via sharding.DynamoDB and Amazon S3 will scale to near limitless storage volume automatically.Amazon RDS instances and databases running on EC2 can be manually resized and EC2 instances can have new EBS volumes added at a later date for additional storage.Instance types can be changed based on changes in activity. For example, you can start with a smaller instance while you are testing, then scale the instance as you begin to receive production traffic to the service. Aurora Serverless V2 automatically scales in response to changes in load.Document requirements around normal and peak performance (transactions per second TPS and queries per second QPS) and consistency (ACID and eventual consistency).Document solution deployment aspects and the database access requirements (global, Mult-AZ, read replication, multiple write nodes)Level of effort for the implementation plan: If you do not have logs or metrics for your data management solution, you will need to complete that before identifying and documenting your data access patterns. Once your data access pattern is understood, selecting, and configuring your data storage is a low level of effort.Related documents:AWS Database CachingAmazon Athena top 10 performance tipsAmazon Aurora best practicesAmazon DynamoDB AcceleratorAmazon DynamoDB best practicesAmazon Redshift Spectrum best practicesAmazon Redshift performanceCloud Databases with AWSAmazon RDS Storage TypesRelated videos:AWS purpose-built databases (DAT209-L)Amazon Aurora storage demystified: How it all works (DAT309-R)Amazon DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns (DAT403-R1)Related examples:Experiment and test with Distributed Load Testing on AWSAWS ServicesAmazon RDS, Amazon AuroraAmazon DynamoDBAmazon DocumentDBAmazon ElastiCacheAmazon NeptuneAmazon TimestreamAmazon KeyspacesAmazon QLDBScaling StorageStorage automatic scaling option available to automatically scale provisioned storage IOPS can also be scaled independently of provisioned storage when leveraging provisioned IOPs storage typesAutomatically scales.

To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users. AWS Shield provides automatic protection against these attacks at no extra cost for AWS service endpoints on your workload. You can augment these features with virtual appliances from APN Partners and the AWS Marketplace to meet your needs.Common anti-patterns:Using public internet addresses on instances or containers and managing the connectivity to them via DNS.Using Internet Protocol addresses instead of domain names for locating services.Providing content (web pages, static assets, media files) to a large geographic area and not using a content delivery network.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By implementing highly available services in your workload, you know that your workload will be available to your users.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnsure that you have highly available connectivity for users of the workload Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public facing endpoints.

For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery.

For example, a database cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. In a serverless workload operating without a VPC, similar layering and segmentation with microservices can achieve the same goal.Components such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database clusters, and AWS Lambda functions that share reachability requirements can be segmented into layers formed by subnets. For example, an Amazon RDS database cluster in a VPC with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. This layered approach for the controls mitigates the impact of a single layer misconfiguration, which could allow unintended access. For Lambda, you can run your functions in your VPC to take advantage of VPC-based controls.For network connectivity that can include thousands of VPCs, AWS accounts, and on-premises networks, you should use AWS Transit Gateway. It acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes. Traffic between an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and AWS Transit Gateway remains on the AWS private network, which reduces external threat vectors such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and common exploits, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, or abuse of broken authentication code. AWS Transit Gateway inter-region peering also encrypts inter-region traffic with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottleneck.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighCreate subnets in VPC: Create subnets for each layer (in groups that include multiple Availability Zones), and associate route tables to control routing.VPCs and subnetsRoute tablesRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorAmazon VPC SecurityGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n* When architecting your network topology, you should examine the connectivity requirements of each component. For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers.A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules.Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs. Many AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, support VPC endpoints, and this technology has been generalized in AWS PrivateLink. We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely. All network traffic on AWS PrivateLink stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the internet. Connectivity can only be initiated by the consumer of the service, and not by the provider of the service. Using AWS PrivateLink for external service access allows you to create air-gapped VPCs with no internet access and helps protect your VPCs from external threat vectors. Third-party services can use AWS PrivateLink to allow their customers to connect to the services from their VPCs over private IP addresses. For VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web proxies that you create and manage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighControl network traffic in a VPC: Implement VPC best practices to control traffic.Amazon VPC securityVPC endpointsAmazon VPC security groupNetwork ACLsControl traffic at the edge: Implement edge services, such as Amazon CloudFront, to provide an additional layer of protection and other features.Amazon CloudFront use casesAWS Global AcceleratorAWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)Amazon Route 53Amazon VPC Ingress RoutingControl private network traffic: Implement services that protect your private traffic for your workload.Amazon VPC PeeringAmazon VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)Amazon VPC Transit GatewayAWS Direct ConnectAWS Site-to-Site VPNAWS Client VPNAmazon S3 Access PointsRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n\nKnowledge Area: How to design network architecture (for example, subnet tiers, routing, IP addressing)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is the best practice the company should employ to control network traffic for the customer data processing and analysis project?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Create a single VPC and configure routing to the internet gateway\",\"is_correct\": false,\"explanation\": \"This option does not provide multiple controls with a defense in depth approach, or segment networks into different layers.\"},{\"answer\": \"Create multiple subnets within one VPC with associated route tables to control routing\",\"is_correct\": true,\"explanation\": \"Creating multiple subnets within a VPC with associated route tables to control routing is a best practice for controlling network traffic.\"},{\"answer\": \"Create a single subnet within one VPC with a single route table\",\"is_correct\": false,\"explanation\": \"This option does not provide multiple controls with a defense in depth approach, or segment networks into different layers.\"},{\"answer\": \"Create multiple VPCs and configure routing to internet gateways\",\"is_correct\": false,\"explanation\": \"This option does not provide multiple controls with a defense in depth approach, or segment networks into different layers.\"}]}", "docs": ["('SEC05-BP01 Create network layers - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html')", "('SEC05-BP02 Control traffic at all layers - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_layered.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A financial services company wants to run a highly available and secure infrastructure to process financial transactions.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 4: Determine high-performing and/or scalable network architectures", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Load balancing concepts (for example, Application Load Balancer)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.When implementing a scale-out architecture where you want to use multiple instances for service content, you can use load balancers inside your Amazon VPC. AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the ELB service. Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.Common anti-patterns:You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.Benefits of establishing this best practice: A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone, or across multiple Availability Zones. Load balancers feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse the appropriate load balancer for your workload: Select the appropriate load balancer for your workload. If you must load balance HTTP requests, we recommend Application Load Balancer. For network and transport protocols (layer 4 \u2013 TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance and low latency applications, we recommend Network Load Balancer.

To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users. AWS Shield provides automatic protection against these attacks at no extra cost for AWS service endpoints on your workload. You can augment these features with virtual appliances from APN Partners and the AWS Marketplace to meet your needs.Common anti-patterns:Using public internet addresses on instances or containers and managing the connectivity to them via DNS.Using Internet Protocol addresses instead of domain names for locating services.Providing content (web pages, static assets, media files) to a large geographic area and not using a content delivery network.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By implementing highly available services in your workload, you know that your workload will be available to your users.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnsure that you have highly available connectivity for users of the workload Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public facing endpoints.

Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements for your hybrid workload. These numbers will drive the sizing requirements for AWS Direct Connect or your VPN endpoints.Desired outcome: When deploying a workload that will need hybrid network connectivity, you have multiple configuration options for connectivity, such as managed and non-managed VPNs or Direct Connect. Select the appropriate connection type for each workload while ensuring you have adequate bandwidth and encryption requirements between your location and the cloud.Common anti-patterns:You only evaluate VPN solutions for your network encryption requirements.You don\u2019t evaluate backup or parallel connectivity options.You use default configurations for routers, tunnels, and BGP sessions.You fail to understand or identify all workload requirements (encryption, protocol, bandwidth and traffic needs).Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and configuring appropriately sized hybrid network solutions will increase the reliability of your workload and maximize performance opportunities. By identifying workload requirements, planning ahead, and evaluating hybrid solutions you will minimize expensive physical network changes and operational overhead while increasing your time to market.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighDevelop a hybrid networking architecture based on your bandwidth requirements: Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements of your hybrid applications. Based on your bandwidth requirements, a single VPN or Direct Connect connection might not be enough, and you must architect a hybrid setup to enable traffic load balancing across multiple connections. Direct connect may be required which offers more predictable and consistent performance due to its private network connectivity. It is great for production workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the AWS environment, from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps. This gives you managed and controlled latency and provisioned bandwidth so your workload can connect easily and in a performant way to other environments. Using one of the AWS Direct Connect partners, you can have end-to-end connectivity from multiple environments, thus providing an extended network with consistent performance.The AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed VPN service for VPCs. When a VPN connection is created, AWS provides tunnels to two different VPN endpoints. With AWS Transit Gateway, you can simplify the connectivity between multiple VPCs and also connect to any VPC attached to AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection. AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale beyond the 1.25Gbps IPsec VPN throughput limit by enabling equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over multiple VPN tunnels.Level of effort for the implementation plan: There is a high level of effort to evaluate workload needs for hybrid networks and to implement hybrid networking solutions.Related documents:Network Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to latency-based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsSite-to-Site VPNBuilding a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network InfrastructureDirect ConnectClient VPNRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)AWS Global AcceleratorDirect ConnectTransit Gateway ConnectVPN SolutionsSecurity with VPN SolutionsRelated examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n\nKnowledge Area: Network connection options (for example, AWS VPN, Direct Connect, AWS PrivateLink\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which method of network connection should be used for a mobile application that needs to access and store data in the cloud?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Site-to-Site VPN\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed VPN service for VPCs, and is not suitable for mobile application that need to access and store data in the cloud.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Direct Connect\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the AWS environment, from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps and is suitable for mobile applications that need to access and store data in the cloud.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"AWS PrivateLink\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"AWS PrivateLink is a networking technology that provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, and is not suitable for mobile applications that need to access and store data in the cloud.\"},\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Transmit Gateway\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Transmit Gateway is a managed service that provides a single gateway to connect multiple VPCs, but is not suitable for mobile applications that need to access and store data in the cloud.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('PERF05-BP03 Choose appropriately sized dedicated connectivity or VPN for hybrid workloads - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_network_hybrid.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A gaming company wants to use AWS to host and scale their multiplayer game servers.", "domain": "Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 4: Determine high-performing and/or scalable network architectures", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Creating a network topology for various architectures (for example, global, hybrid, multi-tier)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

These include multiple cloud environments (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations such as intra- and inter-system connectivity, public IP address management, private IP address management, and domain name resolution.Best practices\n* The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.Best practices\n* Often, multiple approaches are required for optimal performance across a workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve performance.Best practices\n* All components are selected, and architecture is designed to reduce data transfer costs. This includes using components such as wide-area-network (WAN) optimization and Multi-Availability Zone (AZ) configurationsLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowArchitecting for data transfer ensures that you minimize data transfer costs. This may involve using content delivery networks to locate data closer to users, or using dedicated network links from your premises to AWS. You can also use WAN optimization and application optimization to reduce the amount of data that is transferred between components.Implementation stepsSelect components for data transfer: Using the data transfer modeling, focus on where the largest data transfer costs are or where they would be if the workload usage changes. Look for alternative architectures, or additional components that remove or reduce the need for data transfer, or lower its cost.Related documents:AWS caching solutionsDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n* Since the network is between all workload components, it can have great impacts, both positive and negative, on workload performance and behavior. There are also workloads that are heavily dependent on network performance such as High Performance Computing (HPC) where deep network understanding is important to increase cluster performance. You must determine the workload requirements for bandwidth, latency, jitter, and throughput.On AWS, networking is virtualized and is available in a number of different types and configurations. This makes it easier to match your networking methods with your needs. AWS offers product features (for example, Enhanced Networking, Amazon EBS-optimized instances, Amazon S3 transfer acceleration, and dynamic Amazon CloudFront) to optimize network traffic. AWS also offers networking features (for example, Amazon Route 53 latency routing, Amazon VPC endpoints, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS Global Accelerator) to reduce network distance or jitter.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.You must consider location when deploying your network. You can choose to place resources close to where they will be used to reduce distance. Use networking metrics to make changes to networking configuration as the workload evolves. By taking advantage of Regions, placement groups, and edge services, you can significantly improve performance. Cloud based networks can be quickly re-built or modified, so evolving your network architecture over time is necessary to maintain performance efficiency.PERF 5: How do you configure your networking solution?The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.\n* Analyze and understand how network-related decisions impact workload performance. The network is responsible for the connectivity between application components, cloud services, edge networks and on-premises data and therefor it can highly impact workload performance. In addition to workload performance, user experience is also impacted by network latency, bandwidth, protocols, location, network congestion, jitter, throughput, and routing rules.Desired outcome: Have a documented list of networking requirements from the workload including latency, packet size, routing rules, protocols, and supporting traffic patterns. Review the available networking solutions and identify which service meets your workload networking characteristics. Cloud-based networks can be quickly rebuilt, so evolving your network architecture over time is necessary to improve performance efficiency.Common anti-patterns:All traffic flows through your existing data centers.You overbuild Direct Connect sessions without understanding the actual usage requirements.You don\u2019t consider workload characteristics and encryption overhead when defining your networking solutions.You use on-premises concepts and strategies for networking solutions in the cloud.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Understanding how networking impacts workload performance will help you identify potential bottlenecks, improve user experience, increase reliability, and lower operational maintenance as the workload changes.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighIdentify important network performance metrics of your workload and capture its networking characteristics. Define and document requirements as part of a data-driven approach, using benchmarking or load testing. Use this data to identify where your network solution is constrained, and examine configuration options that could improve the workload. Understand the cloud-native networking features and options available and how they can impact your workload performance based on the requirements. Each networking feature has advantages and disadvantages and can be configured to meet your workload characteristics and scale based on your needs.Implementation steps:Define and document networking performance requirements:Include metrics such as network latency, bandwidth, protocols, locations, traffic patterns (spikes and frequency), throughput, encryption, inspection, and routing rulesCapture your foundational networking characteristics:VPC Flow LogsAWS Transit Gateway metricsAWS PrivateLink metricsCapture your application networking characteristics:Elastic Network AdaptorAWS App Mesh metricsAmazon API Gateway metricsCapture your edge networking characteristics:Amazon CloudFront metricsAmazon Route 53 metricsAWS Global Accelerator metricsCapture your hybrid networking characteristics:Direct Connect metricsAWS Site-to-Site VPN metricsAWS Client VPN metricsAWS Cloud WAN metricsCapture your security networking characteristics:AWS Shield, WAF, and Network Firewall metricsCapture end-to-end performance metrics with tracing tools:AWS X-RayAmazon CloudWatch RUMBenchmark and test network performance:Benchmark network throughput: Some factors that can affect EC2 network performance when the instances are in the same VPC.

Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.\n* Foundational requirements are those whose scope extends beyond a single workload or project. Before architecting any system, foundational requirements that influence reliability should be in place. For example, you must have sufficient network bandwidth to your data center.With AWS, most of these foundational requirements are already incorporated or can be addressed as needed. The cloud is designed to be nearly limitless, so it\u2019s the responsibility of AWS to satisfy the requirement for sufficient networking and compute capacity, leaving you free to change resource size and allocations on demand.The following questions focus on these considerations for reliability. (For a list of reliability questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).For cloud-based workload architectures, there are service quotas (which are also referred to as service limits). These quotas exist to prevent accidentally provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API operations to protect services from abuse. Workloads often exist in multiple environments. You must monitor and manage these quotas for all workload environments. These include multiple cloud environments (both publicly accessible and private) and may include your existing data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations, such as intrasystem and intersystem connectivity, public IP address management, private IP address management, and domain name resolution.REL 1: How do you manage service quotas and constraints?For cloud-based workload architectures, there are service quotas (which are also referred to as service limits).

Provide your team members with devices that support their needs with minimized sustainability impact.Best practices:\n* Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.Best practices\n* Manage benefits and risks to make informed decisions when determining where to focus efforts. For example, it may be beneficial to deploy a workload with unresolved issues so that significant new features can be made available to customers. It may be possible to mitigate associated risks, or it may become unacceptable to allow a risk to remain, in which case you will take action to address the risk.You might find that you want to emphasize a small subset of your priorities at some point in time. Use a balanced approach over the long term to ensure the development of needed capabilities and management of risk. Update your priorities as needs changeCommon anti-patterns:You have decided to include a library that does everything you need that one of your developers found on the internet. You have not evaluated the risks of adopting this library from an unknown source and do not know if it contains vulnerabilities or malicious code.You have decided to develop and deploy a new feature instead of fixing an existing issue. You have not evaluated the risks of leaving the issue in place until the feature is deployed and do not know what the impact will be on your customers.You have decided to not deploy a feature frequently requested by customers because of unspecified concerns from your compliance team.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Identifying the available benefits of your choices, and being aware of the risks to your organization, enables you to make informed decisions.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowManage benefits and risks: Balance the benefits of decisions against the risks involved.Identify benefits: Identify benefits based on business goals, needs, and priorities. Examples include time-to-market, security, reliability, performance, and cost.Identify risks: Identify risks based on business goals, needs, and priorities. Examples include time-to-market, security, reliability, performance, and cost.Assess benefits against risks and make informed decisions: Determine the impact of benefits and risks based on goals, needs, and priorities of your key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations. Evaluate the value of the benefit against the probability of the risk being realized and the cost of its impact. For example, emphasizing speed-to-market over reliability might provide competitive advantage. However, it may result in reduced uptime if there are reliability issues.\n* Workloads often have cost requirements for operation. Use internal cost controls to select resource types and sizes based on predicted resource need.Determine which workload components could be replaced with fully managed services, such as managed databases, in-memory caches, and ETL services. Reducing your operational workload allows you to focus resources on business outcomes.For cost requirement best practices, refer to the Cost-Effective Resources section of the Cost Optimization Pillar whitepaper.Common anti-patterns:You only use one family of instances.You do not evaluate licensed solutions versus open-source solutionsYou only use block storage.You deploy common software on EC2 instances and Amazon EBS or ephemeral volumes that are available as a managed service.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Considering cost when making your selections will allow you to enable other investments.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumOptimize workload components to reduce cost: Right size workload components and enable elasticity to reduce cost and maximize component efficiency. Determine which workload components can be replaced with managed services when appropriate, such as managed databases, in-memory caches, and reverse proxies.Related documents:AWS Architecture CenterAWS Partner NetworkAWS Solutions LibraryAWS Knowledge CenterAWS Compute OptimizerRelated videos:Introducing The Amazon Builders\u2019 Library (DOP328)This is my ArchitectureOptimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Related examples:AWS SamplesAWS SDK ExamplesRightsizing with Compute Optimizer and Memory utilization enabledAWS Compute Optimizer Demo code\n* Choose Regions where you will implement your workloads based on both your business requirements and sustainability goals.Best Practice:\n* Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations teams, when determining where to focus efforts on internal customer needs. This will ensure that you have a thorough understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve business outcomes.Use your established priorities to focus your improvement efforts where they will have the greatest impact (for example, developing team skills, improving workload performance, reducing costs, automating runbooks, or enhancing monitoring). Update your priorities as needs change.Common anti-patterns:You have decided to change IP address allocations for your product teams, without consulting them, to make managing your network easier. You do not know the impact this will have on your product teams.You are implementing a new development tool but have not engaged your internal customers to find out if it is needed or if it is compatible with their existing practices.You are implementing a new monitoring system but have not contacted your internal customers to find out if they have monitoring or reporting needs that should be considered.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Evaluating and understanding internal customer needs will inform how you prioritize your efforts to deliver business value.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUnderstand business needs: Business success is enabled by shared goals and understanding across stakeholders including business, development, and operations teams.Review business goals, needs, and priorities of internal customers: Engage key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations teams, to discuss goals, needs, and priorities of internal customers. This ensures that you have a thorough understanding of the operational support that is required to achieve business and customer outcomes.Establish shared understanding: Establish shared understanding of the business functions of the workload, the roles of each of the teams in operating the workload, and how these factors support shared business goals across internal and external customers.Related documents:AWS Well-Architected Framework Concepts \u2013 Feedback loop\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining the appropriate placement of resources to meet business requirements\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"A large corporation wants to move their on-premises compute to the cloud for increased scalability and security.

You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.When implementing a scale-out architecture where you want to use multiple instances for service content, you can use load balancers inside your Amazon VPC. AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the ELB service. Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.Common anti-patterns:You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.Benefits of establishing this best practice: A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone, or across multiple Availability Zones. Load balancers feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse the appropriate load balancer for your workload: Select the appropriate load balancer for your workload. If you must load balance HTTP requests, we recommend Application Load Balancer. For network and transport protocols (layer 4 \u2013 TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance and low latency applications, we recommend Network Load Balancer. Application Load Balancers support HTTPS and Network Load Balancers support TLS encryption offloading.Enable offload of HTTPS or TLS encryption: Elastic Load Balancing includes integrated certificate management, user-authentication, and SSL/TLS decryption. It provides the flexibility to centrally manage TLS settings and offload CPU intensive workloads from your applications. Encrypt all HTTPS traffic as part of your load balancer deployment.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n* Select resource size or type based on data about the workload and resource characteristics.

For example, using strategies like caching data to prevent excessive network or database calls, using read-replicas for database engines to improve read rates, sharding or compressing data where possible to reduce data volumes, and buffering and streaming of results as they are available to avoid blocking.As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes. Measure the impacts to the system and to the end-user to understand how your trade-offs impact your workload. Use a systematic approach, such as load testing, to explore whether the tradeoff improves performance.Common anti-patterns:You assume that workload performance is adequate if customers are not complaining.You only collect data on performance after you have made performance-related changes.Benefits of establishing this best practice: To optimize performance and resource utilization, you need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and historical reference. You can create dashboards and perform metric math on your data to derive operational and utilization insights for your workloads as they change over time.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowUse a data-driven approach to evolve your architecture: As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes.

Using business intelligence services such as Amazon QuickSight you can create and publish interactive dashboards of your workload and operational health (for example, order rates, connected users, and transaction times). Create Dashboards that present system and business-level views of your metrics.Common anti-patterns:Upon request, you run a report on the current utilization of your application for management.During an incident, you are contacted every twenty minutes by a concerned system owner wanting to know if it is fixed yet.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By creating dashboards, you enable self-service access to information enabling your customers to informed themselves and determine if they need to take action.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumCommunicate status through dashboards: Provide dashboards tailored to their target audiences (for example, internal technical teams, leadership, and customers) to communicate the current operating status of the business and provide metrics of interest.

Examples include Amazon CloudWatch dashboards, and AWS Health Dashboard.CloudWatch dashboards create and use customized metrics viewsRelated documents:Amazon QuickSightCloudWatch dashboards create and use customized metrics views\n* Collect log files and metrics histories and analyze these for broader trends and workload insights.Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights supports a simple yet powerful query language that you can use to analyze log data. Amazon CloudWatch Logs also supports subscriptions that allow data to flow seamlessly to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data. It also supports queries on a large array of formats. See Supported SerDes and Data Formats in the Amazon Athena User Guide for more information. For analysis of huge log file sets, you can run an Amazon EMR cluster to run petabyte-scale analyses.There are a number of tools provided by AWS Partners and third parties that allow for aggregation, processing, storage, and analytics. These tools include New Relic, Splunk, Loggly, Logstash, CloudHealth, and Nagios. However, outside generation of system and application logs is unique to each cloud provider, and often unique to each service.An often-overlooked part of the monitoring process is data management. You need to determine the retention requirements for monitoring data, and then apply lifecycle policies accordingly. Amazon S3 supports lifecycle management at the S3 bucket level. This lifecycle management can be applied differently to different paths in the bucket. Toward the end of the lifecycle, you can transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term storage, and then expiration after the end of the retention period is reached. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumCloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs InsightsAmazon CloudWatch Logs Insights Sample QueriesUse Amazon CloudWatch Logs send logs to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data.How do I analyze my Amazon S3 server access logs using Athena?Create an S3 lifecycle policy for your server access logs bucket.

Generate metrics from observations of necessary log content to gain insight into the performance of operations activities.On AWS, you can export your log data to Amazon S3 or send logs directly to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. Using AWS Glue, you can discover and prepare your log data in Amazon S3 for analytics, storing associated metadata in the AWSAWS Glue Data Catalog. Amazon Athena, through its native integration with AWS Glue, can then be used to analyze your log data, querying it using standard SQL. Using a business intelligence tool like Amazon QuickSight you can visualize, explore, and analyze your data.Common anti-patterns:Consistent delivery of new features is considered a key performance indicator. You have no method to measure how frequently deployments occur.You log deployments, rolled back deployments, patches, and rolled back patches to track you operations activities, but no one reviews the metrics.You have a recovery time objective to restore a lost database within fifteen minutes that was defined when the system was deployed and had no users.

For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery.

For example, use a change management workflow to manage Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using tools instead of allowing direct access or a bastion host. This can be achieved using AWS Systems Manager Automation, which uses automation documents that contain steps you use to perform tasks. These documents can be stored in source control, be peer reviewed before running, and tested thoroughly to minimize risk compared to shell access. Business users could have a dashboard instead of direct access to a data store to run queries. Where CI/CD pipelines are not used, determine which controls and processes are required to adequately provide a normally disabled break-glass access mechanism.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowImplement mechanisms to keep people away from data: Mechanisms include using dashboards, such as Amazon QuickSight, to display data to users instead of directly querying.Amazon QuickSightAutomate configuration management: Perform actions at a distance, enforce and validate secure configurations automatically by using a configuration management service or tool.

Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and authorization.Regular access to AWS accounts within the organization should be provided using federated access or a centralized identity provider. You should also centralize your identity management and ensure that there is an established practice to integrate AWS access to your employee access lifecycle. For example, when an employee changes to a job role with a different access level, their group membership should also change to reflect their new access requirements.When defining access requirements for non-human identities, determine which applications and components need access and how permissions are granted. Using IAM roles built with the least privilege access model is a recommended approach. AWS Managed policies provide predefined IAM policies that cover most common use cases.AWS services, such as AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, can help decouple secrets from the application or workload securely in cases where it's not feasible to use IAM roles. In Secrets Manager, you can establish automatic rotation for your credentials. You can use Systems Manager to reference parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, configuration, and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.You can use AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere to obtain temporary security credentials in IAM for workloads that run outside of AWS. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and IAM roles that you use with AWS applications to access AWS resources.Where possible, prefer short-term temporary credentials over long-term static credentials. For scenarios in which you need IAM users with programmatic access and long-term credentials, use access key last used information to rotate and remove access keys.Related documents:Attribute-based access control (ABAC)AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)IAM Roles AnywhereAWS Managed policies for IAM Identity CenterAWS IAM policy conditionsIAM use casesRemove unnecessary credentialsWorking with PoliciesHow to control access to AWS resources based on AWS account, OU, or organizationIdentify, arrange, and manage secrets easily using enhanced search in AWS Secrets ManagerRelated videos:Become an IAM Policy Master in 60 Minutes or LessSeparation of Duties, Least Privilege, Delegation, and CI/CDStreamlining identity and access management for innovation\n* Enforce access control with least privileges and mechanisms, including backups, isolation, and versioning, to help protect your data at rest. Prevent operators from granting public access to your data.Different controls including access (using least privilege), backups (see Reliability whitepaper), isolation, and versioning can all help protect your data at rest. Access to your data should be audited using detective mechanisms covered earlier in this paper including CloudTrail, and service level log, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) access logs.

Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.Best practices\n* A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in time.Best practices\n* The way users consume your workloads and other resources can help you identify improvements to meet sustainability goals. Scale infrastructure to continually match user load and ensure that only the minimum resources required to support users are deployed. Align service levels to customer needs. Position resources to limit the network required for users to consume them. Remove existing, unused assets. Identify created assets that are unused and stop generating them. Provide your team members with devices that support their needs with minimized sustainability impact.Best practices:\n* Back up data, applications, and configuration to meet your requirements for recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).Best practices\n* Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.Best practices\n* Ensure that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make architectural decisions to minimize costs. A small yet effective architectural change can drastically reduce your operational costs over time.Best practices\n* Select resource size or type based on data about the workload and resource characteristics. For example, compute, memory, throughput, or write intensive. This selection is typically made using a previous (on-premises) version of the workload, using documentation, or using other sources of information about the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumSelect resource size or type based on workload and resource characteristics, for example, compute, memory, throughput, or write intensive. This selection is typically made using cost modelling, a previous version of the workload (such as an on-premises version), using documentation, or using other sources of information about the workload (whitepapers, published solutions).Implementation stepsSelect resources based on data: Using your cost modeling data, select the expected workload usage level, then select the specified resource type and size.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAmazon CloudWatch featuresCost Optimization: EC2 Right Sizing\n* Use metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost. Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves your data between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on your usage patterns.Implementation stepsConfigure workload metrics: Ensure you capture the key metrics for the workload. These metrics provide an indication of the customer experience, such as the workload output, and align to the differences between resource types and sizes, such as CPU and memory usage.View rightsizing recommendations: Use the rightsizing recommendations in AWS Compute Optimizer to make adjustments to your workload.Select resource type and size automatically based on metrics: Using the workload metrics, manually or automatically select your workload resources. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling or implementing code within your application can reduce the effort required if frequent changes are needed, and it can potentially implement changes sooner than a manual process.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Compute OptimizerAmazon CloudWatch featuresCloudWatch Getting Set UpCloudWatch Publishing Custom MetricsCost Optimization: Amazon EC2 Right SizingGetting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringLaunch an EC2 Instance Using the SDK\n* Foundational requirements are those whose scope extends beyond a single workload or project. Before architecting any system, foundational requirements that influence reliability should be in place. For example, you must have sufficient network bandwidth to your data center.With AWS, most of these foundational requirements are already incorporated or can be addressed as needed. The cloud is designed to be nearly limitless, so it\u2019s the responsibility of AWS to satisfy the requirement for sufficient networking and compute capacity, leaving you free to change resource size and allocations on demand.The following questions focus on these considerations for reliability. (For a list of reliability questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).For cloud-based workload architectures, there are service quotas (which are also referred to as service limits). These quotas exist to prevent accidentally provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API operations to protect services from abuse. Workloads often exist in multiple environments. You must monitor and manage these quotas for all workload environments. These include multiple cloud environments (both publicly accessible and private) and may include your existing data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations, such as intrasystem and intersystem connectivity, public IP address management, private IP address management, and domain name resolution.REL 1: How do you manage service quotas and constraints?For cloud-based workload architectures, there are service quotas (which are also referred to as service limits). These quotas exist to prevent accidentally provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API operations so as to protect services from abuse. There are also resource constraints, for example, the rate that you can push bits down a fiber-optic cable, or the amount of storage on a physical disk.REL 2: How do you plan your network topology?Workloads often exist in multiple environments. These include multiple cloud environments (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing data center infrastructure.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs also supports subscriptions that allow data to flow seamlessly to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data. It also supports queries on a large array of formats. See Supported SerDes and Data Formats in the Amazon Athena User Guide for more information. For analysis of huge log file sets, you can run an Amazon EMR cluster to run petabyte-scale analyses.There are a number of tools provided by AWS Partners and third parties that allow for aggregation, processing, storage, and analytics. These tools include New Relic, Splunk, Loggly, Logstash, CloudHealth, and Nagios. However, outside generation of system and application logs is unique to each cloud provider, and often unique to each service.An often-overlooked part of the monitoring process is data management. You need to determine the retention requirements for monitoring data, and then apply lifecycle policies accordingly. Amazon S3 supports lifecycle management at the S3 bucket level. This lifecycle management can be applied differently to different paths in the bucket. Toward the end of the lifecycle, you can transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term storage, and then expiration after the end of the retention period is reached. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumCloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs InsightsAmazon CloudWatch Logs Insights Sample QueriesUse Amazon CloudWatch Logs send logs to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data.How do I analyze my Amazon S3 server access logs using Athena?Create an S3 lifecycle policy for your server access logs bucket.

For example, data classification provides a way to categorize organizational data based on levels of sensitivity, and encryption protects data by way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized access. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.In AWS, the following practices facilitate protection of data:As an AWS customer you maintain full control over your data.AWS makes it easier for you to encrypt your data and manage keys, including regular key rotation, which can be easily automated by AWS or maintained by you.Detailed logging that contains important content, such as file access and changes, is available.AWS has designed storage systems for exceptional resiliency. For example, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard\u2013IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and Amazon Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects.Versioning, which can be part of a larger data lifecycle management process, can protect against accidental overwrites, deletes, and similar harm.AWS never initiates the movement of data between Regions. Content placed in a Region will remain in that Region unless you explicitly enable a feature or leverage a service that provides that functionality.The following questions focus on these considerations for security.AWS provides multiple means for encrypting data at rest and in transit. We build features into our services that make it easier to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for the entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).SEC 7: How do you classify your data?Classification provides a way to categorize data, based on criticality and sensitivity in order to help you determine appropriate protection and retention controls.SEC 8: How do you protect your data at rest?Protect your data at rest by implementing multiple controls, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.SEC 9: How do you protect your data in transit?Protect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss.\n* Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your workload.

Aspects including the duration for which you retain data, data destruction processes, data access management, data transformation, and data sharing should be considered. When choosing a data classification methodology, balance usability versus access. You should also accommodate the multiple levels of access and nuances for implementing a secure, but still usable, approach for each level. Always use a defense in depth approach and reduce human access to data and mechanisms for transforming, deleting, or copying data. For example, require users to strongly authenticate to an application, and give the application, rather than the users, the requisite access permission to perform action at a distance. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted network path and require access to the decryption keys. Use tools, such as dashboards and automated reporting, to give users information from the data rather than giving them direct access to the data.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIdentify data types: Identify the types of data that you are storing or processing in your workload.

Workload usage can change over time, and different services may be more cost effective at different levels.Use AWS Cost Explorer or the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) to understand and model your data transfer costs. Configure a proof of concept (PoC) or test your workload, and run a test with a realistic simulated load. You can model your costs at different workload demands.Implementation stepsCalculate data transfer costs: Use the AWS pricing pages and calculate the data transfer costs for the workload. Calculate the data transfer costs at different usage levels, for both increases and reductions in workload usage. Where there are multiple options for the workload architecture, calculate the cost for each option for comparison.Link costs to outcomes: For each data transfer cost incurred, specify the outcome that it achieves for the workload. If it is transfer between components, it may be for decoupling, if it is between Availability Zones it may be for redundancy.Related documents:AWS caching solutionsAWS PricingAmazon EC2 PricingAmazon VPC pricingDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n* Protect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss.Best practices\n* Implement services to reduce data transfer. For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery. Also look for caching services where there is repeated access to data, or large amounts of data.Related documents:AWS Direct ConnectAWS Explore Our ProductsAWS caching solutionsAmazon CloudFrontDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n* Understand how data is used within your workload, consumed by your users, transferred, and stored. Select technologies to minimize data processing and storage requirements.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAnalyze your data access and storage patterns.Store data files in efficient file formats such as Parquet to prevent unnecessary processing (for example, when running analytics) and to reduce the total storage provisioned.Use technologies that work natively with compressed data.Use the database engine that best supports your dominant query pattern.Manage your database indexes to ensure index designs support efficient query execution.Select network protocols that reduce the amount of network capacity consumed.Related documents:Athena Compression Support file formatsCOPY from columnar data formats with Amazon RedshiftConverting Your Input Record Format in Kinesis Data FirehoseFormat Options for ETL Inputs and Outputs in AWS GlueImprove query performance on Amazon Athena by Converting to Columnar FormatsLoading compressed data files from Amazon S3 with Amazon RedshiftMonitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon AuroraMonitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon RDSAWS IoT FleetWiseRelated videos:Building Sustainably on AWS\n* The optimal database solution for a system varies based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability. Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* Distributed systems rely on communications networks to interconnect components, such as servers or services. Your workload must operate reliably despite data loss or latency in these networks. Components of the distributed system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or the workload.

Prevent operators from granting public access to your data.Different controls including access (using least privilege), backups (see Reliability whitepaper), isolation, and versioning can all help protect your data at rest. Access to your data should be audited using detective mechanisms covered earlier in this paper including CloudTrail, and service level log, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) access logs. You should inventory what data is publicly accessible, and plan for how you can reduce the amount of data available over time.

Understand where and how to use provisioned IOPS, SSDs, magnetic storage, object storage, archival storage, or ephemeral storage to optimize storage space and performance for your workload.Amazon EBS provides a range of options that allow you to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload. These options are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads, such as databases and boot volumes (performance depends primarily on IOPS), and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads, such as MapReduce and log processing (performance depends primarily on MB/s).SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance provisioned IOPS SSD for latency-sensitive transactional workloads and general-purpose SSD that balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast transfer of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. Transfer acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to route data over an optimized network path. For a workload in an S3 bucket that has intensive GET requests, use Amazon S3 with CloudFront. When uploading large files, use multi-part uploads with multiple parts uploading at the same time to help maximize network throughput.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes: general purpose performance mode, and max I/O performance mode. There are also two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: Bursting Throughput, and Provisioned Throughput. To determine which settings to use for your workload, see the Amazon EFS User Guide.Amazon FSx provides four file systems to choose from: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for enterprise workloads, Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance workloads, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for NetApps popular ONTAP file system, and Amazon FSx for OpenZFS for Linux-based file servers. FSx is SSD-backed and is designed to deliver fast, predictable, scalable, and consistent performance. Amazon FSx file systems deliver sustained high read and write speeds and consistent low latency data access. You can choose the throughput level you need to match your workload\u2019s needs.Common anti-patterns:You only use one storage type, such as Amazon EBS, for all workloads.You use Provisioned IOPS for all workloads without real-world testing against all storage tiers.You assume that all workloads have similar storage access performance requirements.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Evaluating all storage service options can reduce the cost of infrastructure and the effort required to maintain your workloads. It can potentially accelerate your time to market for deploying new services and features.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumDetermine storage characteristics: When you evaluate a storage solution, determine which storage characteristics you require, such as ability to share, file size, cache size, latency, throughput, and persistence of data.

It eliminates the manual processes and time associated with provisioning on-premises infrastructure, including identifying hardware specifications, negotiating price quotations, managing purchase orders, scheduling shipments, and then deploying the resources. However, the ease of use and virtually unlimited on-demand capacity requires a new way of thinking about expenditures.Many businesses are composed of multiple systems run by various teams. The capability to attribute resource costs to the individual organization or product owners drives efficient usage behavior and helps reduce waste. Accurate cost attribution allows you to know which products are truly profitable, and allows you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate budget.In AWS, you create an account structure with AWS Organizations or AWS Control Tower, which provides separation and assists in allocation of your costs and usage. You can also use resource tagging to apply business and organization information to your usage and cost. Use AWS Cost Explorer for visibility into your cost and usage, or create customized dashboards and analytics with Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight. Controlling your cost and usage is done by notifications through AWS Budgets, and controls using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Service Quotas.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.You can use cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS usage and costs. When you apply tags to your AWS resources (such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets), AWS generates a cost and usage report with your usage and your tags. You can apply tags that represent organization categories (such as cost centers, workload names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.Ensure you use the right level of detail and granularity in cost and usage reporting and monitoring. For high level insights and trends, use daily granularity with AWS Cost Explorer. For deeper analysis and inspection use hourly granularity in AWS Cost Explorer, or Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight with the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) at an hourly granularity.Combining tagged resources with entity lifecycle tracking (employees, projects) makes it possible to identify orphaned resources or projects that are no longer generating value to the organization and should be decommissioned. You can set up billing alerts to notify you of predicted overspending.COST 2: How do you govern usage?Establish policies and mechanisms to ensure that appropriate costs are incurred while objectives are achieved. By employing a checks-and-balances approach, you can innovate without overspending.COST 3: How do you monitor usage and cost?Establish policies and procedures to monitor and appropriately allocate your costs. This allows you to measure and improve the cost efficiency of this workload.COST 4: How do you decommission resources?Implement change control and resource management from project inception to end-of-life. This ensures you shut down or terminate unused resources to reduce waste.\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Configure AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets inline with your organization policies.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighTo modify usage and adjust costs, each person in your organization must have access to their cost and usage information. It is recommended that all workloads and teams have the following tooling configured when they use the cloud:Reports: Summarize of all cost and usage informationNotifications: Provide notifications when cost or usage is outside of defined limits.Current State: Configure a dashboard showing current levels of cost and usage. The dashboard should be available in a highly visible place within the work environment (similar to an operations dashboard).Trending: Provide the capability to show the variability in cost and usage over the required period of time, with the required granularity.Forecasts: Provide the capability to show estimated future costs.Tracking: Show the current cost and usage against configured goals or targets.Analysis: Provide the capability for team members to perform custom and deep analysis down to the hourly granularity, with all possible dimensions.You can use AWS native tooling, such as AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and Amazon Athena with Amazon QuickSight to provide this capability. You can also use third-party tooling \u2014 however, you must ensure that the costs of this tooling provide value to your organization.Implementation stepsCreate a Cost Optimization group: Configure your account and create a group that has access to the required Cost and Usage reports. This group must include representatives from all teams that own or manage an application. This certifies that every team has access to their cost and usage information.Configure AWS Budgets: Configure AWS Budgets on all accounts for your workload.

Regularly review the costs with configured tools or out of the box tools, do not just look at costs and categories when you receive notifications. Monitoring and analyzing costs proactively helps to identify positive trends and allows you to promote them throughout your organization.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIt is recommended to monitor cost and usage proactively within your organization, not just when there are exceptions or anomalies. Highly visible dashboards throughout your office or work environment ensure that key people have access to the information they need, and indicate the organization\u2019s focus on cost optimization. Visible dashboards allow you to actively promote successful outcomes and implement them throughout your organization.Create a daily or frequent routine to use AWS Cost Explorer or any other dashboard such as Amazon QuickSight to see the costs and analyze proactively. Analyze AWS service usage and costs at the AWS account-level, workload-level, or specific AWS service-level with grouping and filtering, and validate whether they are expected or not. Use the hourly- and resource-level granularity and tags to filter and identify incurring costs for the top resources. You can also build your own reports with the Cost Intelligence Dashboard, an Amazon QuickSight solution built by AWS Solutions Architects, and compare your budgets with the actual cost and usage.Implementation stepsReport on cost optimization: Set up a regular cycle to discuss and analyze the efficiency of the workload. Using the metrics established, report on the metrics achieved and the cost of achieving them. Identify and fix any negative trends, and identify positive trends to promote across your organization. Reporting should involve representatives from the application teams and owners, finance, and management.Create and enable daily granularity AWS Budgets for the cost and usage to take timely actions to prevent any potential cost overruns: AWS Budgets allow you to configure alert notifications, so you stay informed if any of your budget types fall out of your pre-configured thresholds. The best way to leverage AWS Budgets is to set your expected cost and usage as your limits, so that anything above your budgets can be considered overspend.Create AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for cost monitor: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses advanced Machine Learning technology to identify anomalous spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. It allows you to configure cost monitors that define spend segments you want to evaluate (for example, individual AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories), and lets you set when, where, and how you receive your alert notifications. For each monitor, attach multiple alert subscriptions for business owners and technology teams, including a name, a cost impact threshold, and alerting frequency (individual alerts, daily summary, weekly summary) for each subscription.Use AWS Cost Explorer or integrate your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data with Amazon QuickSight dashboards to visualize your organization\u2019s costs: AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. The Cost Intelligence Dashboard is a customizable and accessible dashboard to help create the foundation of your own cost management and optimization tool.Related documents:AWS BudgetsAWS Cost ExplorerDaily Cost and Usage BudgetsAWS Cost Anomaly DetectionRelated examples:Well-Architected Labs: VisualizationWell-Architected Labs: Advanced VisualizationWell-Architected Labs: Cloud Intelligence DashboardsWell-Architected Labs: Cost VisualizationAWS Cost Anomaly Detection Alert with Slack\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS cost management tools with appropriate use cases (for example, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Report)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which AWS cost management tool would be appropriate for a startup to use to monitor the cost of their new web application?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"AWS Cost Explorer\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.\"},{\"answer\": \"Amazon QuickSight\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon QuickSight is a visualization tool but does not provide cost management capabilities.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Budgets\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Budgets allow you to configure alert notifications, so you stay informed if any of your budget types fall out of your pre-configured thresholds.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Cost and Usage Report\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"The AWS Cost and Usage Report is a data source for cost and usage analysis, but it does not provide cost management capabilities.\"}]}", "docs": ["('COST03-BP04 Configure billing and cost management tools - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_monitor_usage_config_tools.html')", "('COST01-BP06 Monitor cost proactively - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_cloud_financial_management_proactive_process.html')"]}, {"scenario": "An education organization wants to use AWS to deliver online learning courses to students globally.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design cost-optimized storage solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "AWS storage services with appropriate use cases (for example, Amazon FSx, Amazon EFS, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Select from object, block, and file storage services as well as cloud data migration options for your workload.In AWS, storage is available in three forms: object, block, and file:Object Storage provides a scalable, durable platform to make data accessible from any internet location for user-generated content, active archive, serverless computing, Big Data storage or backup and recovery. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.Block Storage provides highly available, consistent, low-latency block storage for each virtual host and is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by EC2 instances that helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and cost.File Storage provides access to a shared file system across multiple systems. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories. Amazon FSx makes it easy and cost effective to launch and run popular file systems so you can leverage the rich feature sets and fast performance of widely used open source and commercially-licensed file systems.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When you select a storage solution, ensuring that it aligns with your access patterns will be critical to achieving the performance you want.PERF 3: How do you select your storage solution?The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints.

Services such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB additionally support automated backup that enables point-in-time recovery (PITR), which allows you to restore a backup to any time up to five minutes or less before the current time. Many AWS services offer the ability to copy backups to another AWS Region. AWS Backup is a tool that gives you the ability to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services.Amazon S3 can be used as a backup destination for self-managed and AWS-managed data sources. AWS services such as Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB have built in capabilities to create backups. Third-party backup software can also be used.On-premises data can be backed up to the AWS Cloud using AWS Storage Gateway or AWS DataSync. Amazon S3 buckets can be used to store this data on AWS. Amazon S3 offers multiple storage tiers such as Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive to reduce cost of data storage.You might be able to meet data recovery needs by reproducing the data from other sources. For example, Amazon Elasticache replica nodes or RDS read replicas could be used to reproduce data if the primary is lost. In cases where sources like this can be used to meet your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO), you might not require a backup. Another example, if working with Amazon EMR, it might not be necessary to backup your HDFS data store, as long as you can reproduce the data into EMR from S3.When selecting a backup strategy, consider the time it takes to recover data. The time needed to recover data depends on the type of backup (in the case of a backup strategy), or the complexity of the data reproduction mechanism. This time should fall within the RTO for the workload.Desired Outcome:Data sources have been identified and classified based on criticality. Then, establish a strategy for data recovery based on the RPO. This strategy involves either backing up these data sources, or having the ability to reproduce data from other sources. In the case of data loss, the strategy implemented enables recovery or reproduction of data within the defined RPO and RTO.Cloud Maturity Phase: FoundationalCommon anti-patterns:Not aware of all data sources for the workload and their criticality.Not taking backups of critical data sources.Taking backups of only some data sources without using criticality as a criterion.No defined RPO, or backup frequency cannot meet RPO.Not evaluating if a backup is necessary or if data can be reproduced from other sources.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Identifying the places where backups are necessary and implementing a mechanism to create backups, or being able to reproduce the data from an external source improves the ability to restore and recover data during an outage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUnderstand and use the backup capabilities of the AWS services and resources used by the workload. Most AWS services provides capabilities to back up workload data.Implementation Steps:Identify all data sources for the workload. Data can be stored on a number of resources such as databases, volumes, filesystems, logging systems, and object storage. Refer to the Resources section to find Related documents on different AWS services where data is stored, and the backup capability these services provide.Classify data sources based on criticality. Different data sets will have different levels of criticality for a workload, and therefore different requirements for resiliency. For example, some data might be critical and require a RPO near zero, while other data might be less critical and can tolerate a higher RPO and some data loss. Similarly, different data sets might have different RTO requirements as well.Use AWS or third-party services to create backups of the data. AWS Backup is a managed service that enables creating backups of various data sources on AWS. Most of these services also have native capabilities to create backups. The AWS Marketplace has many solutions that provide these capabilites as well. Refer to the Resources listed below for information on how to create backups of data from various AWS services.For data that is not backed up, establish a data reproduction mechanism. You might choose not to backup data that can be reproduced from other sources for various reasons. There might be a situation where it is cheaper to reproduce data from sources when needed rather than creating a backup as there may be a cost associated with storing backups. Another example is where restoring from a backup takes longer than reproducing the data from sources, resulting in a breach in RTO. In such situations, consider tradeoffs and establish a well-defined process for how data can be reproduced from these sources when data recovery is necessary. For example, if you have loaded data from Amazon S3 to a data warehouse (like Amazon Redshift), or MapReduce cluster (like Amazon EMR) to do analysis on that data, this may be an example of data that can be reproduced from other sources. As long as the results of these analyses are either stored somewhere or reproducible, you would not suffer a data loss from a failure in the data warehouse or MapReduce cluster. Other examples that can be reproduced from sources include caches (like Amazon ElastiCache) or RDS read replicas.Establish a cadence for backing up data. Creating backups of data sources is a periodic process and the frequency should depend on the RPO.Level of effort for the Implementation Plan: ModerateRelated Best Practices:REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data lossREL13-BP02 Use defined recovery strategies to meet the recovery objectivesRelated documents:What Is AWS Backup?What is AWS DataSync?What is Volume Gateway?APN Partner: partners that can help with backupAWS Marketplace: products that can be used for backupAmazon EBS SnapshotsBacking Up Amazon EFSBacking up Amazon FSx for Windows File ServerBackup and Restore for ElastiCache for RedisCreating a DB Cluster Snapshot in NeptuneCreating a DB SnapshotCreating an EventBridge Rule That Triggers on a ScheduleCross-Region Replication with Amazon S3EFS-to-EFS AWS BackupExporting Log Data to Amazon S3Object lifecycle managementOn-Demand Backup and Restore for DynamoDBPoint-in-time recovery for DynamoDBWorking with Amazon OpenSearch Service Index SnapshotsRelated videos:AWS re:Invent 2021 - Backup, disaster recovery, and ransomware protection with AWSAWS Backup Demo: Cross-Account and Cross-Region BackupAWS re:Invent 2019: Deep dive on AWS Backup, ft.

Understand where and how to use provisioned IOPS, SSDs, magnetic storage, object storage, archival storage, or ephemeral storage to optimize storage space and performance for your workload.Amazon EBS provides a range of options that allow you to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload. These options are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads, such as databases and boot volumes (performance depends primarily on IOPS), and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads, such as MapReduce and log processing (performance depends primarily on MB/s).SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance provisioned IOPS SSD for latency-sensitive transactional workloads and general-purpose SSD that balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast transfer of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. Transfer acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to route data over an optimized network path. For a workload in an S3 bucket that has intensive GET requests, use Amazon S3 with CloudFront. When uploading large files, use multi-part uploads with multiple parts uploading at the same time to help maximize network throughput.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries. Considerations around highly specialized query functionality for text and natural language processing, time series, and graphs must also be taken into account.Desired outcome: The data storage has been selected based on identified and documented data access patterns. This might include the most common read, write and delete queries, the need for ad-hoc calculations and aggregations, complexity of the data, the data interdependency, and the required consistency needs.Common anti-patterns:You only select one database vendor to simplify operations management.You assume that data access patterns will stay consistent over time.You implement complex transactions, rollback, and consistency logic in the application.The database is configured to support a potential high traffic burst, which results in the database resources remaining idle most of the time.Using a shared database for transactional and analytical uses.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and optimizing your data storage based on access patterns will help decrease development complexity and optimize your performance opportunities. Understanding when to use read replicas, global tables, data partitioning, and caching will help you decrease operational overhead and scale based on your workload needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumIdentify and evaluate your data access pattern to select the correct storage configuration. Each database solution has options to configure and optimize your storage solution. Use the collected metrics and logs and experiment with options to find the optimal configuration. Use the following table to review storage options per database service.Implementation steps:Identify and document the anticipated growth of the data and traffic.Amazon RDS and Aurora support storage automatic scaling up to documented limits. Beyond this, consider transitioning older data to Amazon S3 for archival, aggregating historical data for analytics or scaling horizontally via sharding.DynamoDB and Amazon S3 will scale to near limitless storage volume automatically.Amazon RDS instances and databases running on EC2 can be manually resized and EC2 instances can have new EBS volumes added at a later date for additional storage.Instance types can be changed based on changes in activity. For example, you can start with a smaller instance while you are testing, then scale the instance as you begin to receive production traffic to the service. Aurora Serverless V2 automatically scales in response to changes in load.Document requirements around normal and peak performance (transactions per second TPS and queries per second QPS) and consistency (ACID and eventual consistency).Document solution deployment aspects and the database access requirements (global, Mult-AZ, read replication, multiple write nodes)Level of effort for the implementation plan: If you do not have logs or metrics for your data management solution, you will need to complete that before identifying and documenting your data access patterns. Once your data access pattern is understood, selecting, and configuring your data storage is a low level of effort.Related documents:AWS Database CachingAmazon Athena top 10 performance tipsAmazon Aurora best practicesAmazon DynamoDB AcceleratorAmazon DynamoDB best practicesAmazon Redshift Spectrum best practicesAmazon Redshift performanceCloud Databases with AWSAmazon RDS Storage TypesRelated videos:AWS purpose-built databases (DAT209-L)Amazon Aurora storage demystified: How it all works (DAT309-R)Amazon DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns (DAT403-R1)Related examples:Experiment and test with Distributed Load Testing on AWSAWS ServicesAmazon RDS, Amazon AuroraAmazon DynamoDBAmazon DocumentDBAmazon ElastiCacheAmazon NeptuneAmazon TimestreamAmazon KeyspacesAmazon QLDBScaling StorageStorage automatic scaling option available to automatically scale provisioned storage IOPS can also be scaled independently of provisioned storage when leveraging provisioned IOPs storage typesAutomatically scales.

Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.Best practices\n* Cloud storage is a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information used by your workload. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Select from object, block, and file storage services as well as cloud data migration options for your workload.In AWS, storage is available in three forms: object, block, and file:Object Storage provides a scalable, durable platform to make data accessible from any internet location for user-generated content, active archive, serverless computing, Big Data storage or backup and recovery. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.Block Storage provides highly available, consistent, low-latency block storage for each virtual host and is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by EC2 instances that helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and cost.File Storage provides access to a shared file system across multiple systems. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories. Amazon FSx makes it easy and cost effective to launch and run popular file systems so you can leverage the rich feature sets and fast performance of widely used open source and commercially-licensed file systems.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When you select a storage solution, ensuring that it aligns with your access patterns will be critical to achieving the performance you want.PERF 3: How do you select your storage solution?The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.\n* Evaluate the various characteristics and configuration options and how they relate to storage. Understand where and how to use provisioned IOPS, SSDs, magnetic storage, object storage, archival storage, or ephemeral storage to optimize storage space and performance for your workload.Amazon EBS provides a range of options that allow you to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload. These options are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads, such as databases and boot volumes (performance depends primarily on IOPS), and HDD-backed storage for throughput-intensive workloads, such as MapReduce and log processing (performance depends primarily on MB/s).SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance provisioned IOPS SSD for latency-sensitive transactional workloads and general-purpose SSD that balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast transfer of files over long distances between your client and your S3 bucket. Transfer acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to route data over an optimized network path. For a workload in an S3 bucket that has intensive GET requests, use Amazon S3 with CloudFront. When uploading large files, use multi-part uploads with multiple parts uploading at the same time to help maximize network throughput.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes: general purpose performance mode, and max I/O performance mode. There are also two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: Bursting Throughput, and Provisioned Throughput. To determine which settings to use for your workload, see the Amazon EFS User Guide.Amazon FSx provides four file systems to choose from: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for enterprise workloads, Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance workloads, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for NetApps popular ONTAP file system, and Amazon FSx for OpenZFS for Linux-based file servers. FSx is SSD-backed and is designed to deliver fast, predictable, scalable, and consistent performance. Amazon FSx file systems deliver sustained high read and write speeds and consistent low latency data access. You can choose the throughput level you need to match your workload\u2019s needs.Common anti-patterns:You only use one storage type, such as Amazon EBS, for all workloads.You use Provisioned IOPS for all workloads without real-world testing against all storage tiers.You assume that all workloads have similar storage access performance requirements.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Evaluating all storage service options can reduce the cost of infrastructure and the effort required to maintain your workloads. It can potentially accelerate your time to market for deploying new services and features.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumDetermine storage characteristics: When you evaluate a storage solution, determine which storage characteristics you require, such as ability to share, file size, cache size, latency, throughput, and persistence of data. Then match your requirements to the AWS service that best fits your needs.Related documents:Cloud Storage with AWSAmazon EBS Volume TypesAmazon EC2 StorageAmazon EFS: Amazon EFS PerformanceAmazon FSx for Lustre PerformanceAmazon FSx for Windows File Server PerformanceAmazon Glacier: Amazon Glacier DocumentationAmazon S3: Request Rate and Performance ConsiderationsCloud Storage with AWSCloud Storage with AWSEBS I/O CharacteristicsRelated videos:Deep dive on Amazon EBS (STG303-R1)Optimize your storage performance with Amazon S3 (STG343)Related examples:Amazon EFS CSI DriverAmazon EBS CSI DriverAmazon EFS UtilitiesAmazon EBS AutoscaleAmazon S3 Examples\n\nKnowledge Area: Storage types with associated characteristics (for example, object, file, block)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"When selecting a storage solution for a research institution that wants to perform data analysis on a large dataset using AWS compute resources, which storage type and characteristics should be considered to optimize performance?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\":\"The type of access method (block, file, or object) and the patterns of access (random or sequential)\", \"is_correct\":\"true\",\"explanation\":\"The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints.

Increase storage efficiency by choosing object storage over block storage. Configure the storage options you choose to match your data access patterns.How you access data impacts how the storage solution performs. Select the storage solution that aligns best to your access patterns, or consider changing your access patterns to align with the storage solution to maximize performance.Creating a RAID 0 array allows you to achieve a higher level of performance for a file system than what you can provision on a single volume. Consider using RAID 0 when I/O performance is more important than fault tolerance. For example, you could use it with a heavily used database where data replication is already set up separately.Select appropriate storage metrics for your workload across all of the storage options consumed for the workload. When using filesystems that use burst credits, create alarms to let you know when you are approaching those credit limits. You must create storage dashboards to show the overall workload storage health.For storage systems that are a fixed size, such as Amazon EBS or Amazon FSx, ensure that you are monitoring the amount of storage used versus the overall storage size and create automation if possible to increase the storage size when reaching a thresholdCommon anti-patterns:You assume that storage performance is adequate if customers are not complaining.You only use one tier of storage, assuming all workloads fit within that tier.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and historical reference to optimize performance and resource utilization. You can create automatic dashboards and data with one-second granularity to perform metric math on your data and derive operational and utilization insights for your storage needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowOptimize your storage usage and access patterns: Choose storage systems based on your workload's access patterns and the characteristics of the available storage options. Determine the best place to store data that will enable you to meet your requirements while reducing overhead. Use performance optimizations and access patterns when configuring and interacting with data based on the characteristics of your storage (for example, striping volumes or partitioning data).Select appropriate metrics for storage options: Ensure that you select the appropriate storage metrics for the workload. Each storage option offers various metrics to track how your workload performs over time. Ensure that you are measuring against any storage burst metrics (for example, monitoring burst credits for Amazon EFS). For storage systems that are fixed sized, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store or Amazon FSx, ensure that you are monitoring the amount of storage used versus the overall storage size. Create automation when possible to increase the storage size when reaching a threshold.Monitor metrics: Amazon CloudWatch can collect metrics across the resources in your architecture. You can also collect and publish custom metrics to surface business or derived metrics. Use CloudWatch or third-party solutions to set alarms that indicate when thresholds are breached.Related documents:Amazon EBS Volume TypesAmazon EC2 StorageAmazon EFS: Amazon EFS PerformanceAmazon FSx for Lustre PerformanceAmazon FSx for Windows File Server PerformanceAmazon Glacier: Amazon Glacier DocumentationAmazon S3: Request Rate and Performance ConsiderationsCloud Storage with AWSEBS I/O CharacteristicsMonitoring and understanding Amazon EBS performance using Amazon CloudWatchRelated videos:Deep dive on Amazon EBS (STG303-R1)Optimize your storage performance with Amazon S3 (STG343)Related examples:Amazon EFS CSI DriverAmazon EBS CSI DriverAmazon EFS UtilitiesAmazon EBS AutoscaleAmazon S3 Examples\n* Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your workload.

Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves your data between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on your usage patterns.Implementation stepsConfigure workload metrics: Ensure you capture the key metrics for the workload. These metrics provide an indication of the customer experience, such as the workload output, and align to the differences between resource types and sizes, such as CPU and memory usage.View rightsizing recommendations: Use the rightsizing recommendations in AWS Compute Optimizer to make adjustments to your workload.Select resource type and size automatically based on metrics: Using the workload metrics, manually or automatically select your workload resources. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling or implementing code within your application can reduce the effort required if frequent changes are needed, and it can potentially implement changes sooner than a manual process.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Compute OptimizerAmazon CloudWatch featuresCloudWatch Getting Set UpCloudWatch Publishing Custom MetricsCost Optimization: Amazon EC2 Right SizingGetting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringLaunch an EC2 Instance Using the SDK\n* Analyze the various performance characteristics of your workload and how these characteristics relate to memory, network, and CPU usage. Use this data to choose resources that best match your workload's profile. For example, a memory-intensive workload, such as a database, could be served best by the r-family of instances. However, a bursting workload can benefit more from an elastic container system.Common anti-patterns:You choose the largest instance available for all workloads.You standardize all instances types to one type for ease of management.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Being familiar with the AWS compute offerings allows you to determine the correct solution for your various workloads.

This identifies the lowest cost point for its current data transfer requirements.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUnderstand where the data transfer occurs in your workload, the cost of the transfer, and its associated benefit. This allows you to make an informed decision to modify or accept the architectural decision. For example, you may have a Multi-Availability Zone configuration where you replicate data between the Availability Zones. You model the cost of structure and decide that this is an acceptable cost (similar to paying for compute and storage in both Availability Zone) to achieve the required reliability and resilience.Model the costs over different usage levels. Workload usage can change over time, and different services may be more cost effective at different levels.Use AWS Cost Explorer or the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) to understand and model your data transfer costs. Configure a proof of concept (PoC) or test your workload, and run a test with a realistic simulated load. You can model your costs at different workload demands.Implementation stepsCalculate data transfer costs: Use the AWS pricing pages and calculate the data transfer costs for the workload. Calculate the data transfer costs at different usage levels, for both increases and reductions in workload usage. Where there are multiple options for the workload architecture, calculate the cost for each option for comparison.Link costs to outcomes: For each data transfer cost incurred, specify the outcome that it achieves for the workload. If it is transfer between components, it may be for decoupling, if it is between Availability Zones it may be for redundancy.Related documents:AWS caching solutionsAWS PricingAmazon EC2 PricingAmazon VPC pricingDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n* All components are selected, and architecture is designed to reduce data transfer costs. This includes using components such as wide-area-network (WAN) optimization and Multi-Availability Zone (AZ) configurationsLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowArchitecting for data transfer ensures that you minimize data transfer costs. This may involve using content delivery networks to locate data closer to users, or using dedicated network links from your premises to AWS. You can also use WAN optimization and application optimization to reduce the amount of data that is transferred between components.Implementation stepsSelect components for data transfer: Using the data transfer modeling, focus on where the largest data transfer costs are or where they would be if the workload usage changes.

Then either notify the appropriate personnel to manually scale the resource, or trigger automation to automatically scale it.Scale can be manually adjusted for your workload, for example, changing the number of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group or modifying throughput of a DynamoDB table can be done through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. However automation should be used whenever possible (refer to Use automation when obtaining or scaling resources).Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumObtain resources upon detection of impairment to a workload. Scale resources reactively when necessary if availability is impacted, to restore workload availability.Use scaling plans, which are the core component of AWS Auto Scaling, to configure a set of instructions for scaling your resources. If you work with AWS CloudFormation or add tags to AWS resources, you can set up scaling plans for different sets of resources, per application. AWS Auto Scaling provides recommendations for scaling strategies customized to each resource. After you create your scaling plan, AWS Auto Scaling combines dynamic scaling and predictive scaling methods together to support your scaling strategy.AWS Auto Scaling: How Scaling Plans WorkAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes above this size.What Is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?Amazon DynamoDB auto scaling uses the AWS Application Auto Scaling service to dynamically adjust provisioned throughput capacity on your behalf, in response to actual traffic patterns. This enables a table or a global secondary index to increase its provisioned read and write capacity to handle sudden increases in traffic, without throttling.Managing Throughput Capacity Automatically with DynamoDB Auto ScalingRelated documents:APN Partner: partners that can help you create automated compute solutionsAWS Auto Scaling: How Scaling Plans WorkAWS Marketplace: products that can be used with auto scalingManaging Throughput Capacity Automatically with DynamoDB Auto ScalingWhat Is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?\n* Scale resources proactively to meet demand and avoid availability impact.Many AWS services automatically scale to meet demand. If using Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon ECS clusters, you can configure automatic scaling of these to occur based on usage metrics that correspond to demand for your workload. For Amazon EC2, average CPU utilization, load balancer request count, or network bandwidth can be used to scale out (or scale in) EC2 instances. For Amazon ECS, average CPU utilization, load balancer request count, and memory utilization can be used to scale out (or scale in) ECS tasks. Using Target Auto Scaling on AWS, the autoscaler acts like a household thermostat, adding or removing resources to maintain the target value (for example, 70% CPU utilization) that you specify.AWS Auto Scaling can also do Predictive Auto Scaling, which uses machine learning to analyze each resource's historical workload and regularly forecasts the future load for the next two days.Little\u2019s Law helps calculate how many instances of compute (EC2 instances, concurrent Lambda functions, etc.) that you need.L = \u03bbWL = number of instances (or mean concurrency in the system)\u03bb = mean rate at which requests arrive (req/sec)W = mean time that each request spends in the system (sec)For example, at 100 rps, if each request takes 0.5 seconds to process, you will need 50 instances to keep up with demand.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumObtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload. Scale resources proactively to meet demand and avoid availability impact.Calculate how many compute resources you will need (compute concurrency) to handle a given request rate.Telling Stories About Little's LawWhen you have a historical pattern for usage, set up scheduled scaling for Amazon EC2 auto scaling.Scheduled Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingUse AWS predictive scaling.Predictive Scaling for EC2, Powered by Machine LearningRelated documents:AWS Auto Scaling: How Scaling Plans WorkAWS Marketplace: products that can be used with auto scalingManaging Throughput Capacity Automatically with DynamoDB Auto ScalingPredictive Scaling for EC2, Powered by Machine LearningScheduled Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingTelling Stories About Little's LawWhat Is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining when storage auto scaling is required\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following is necessary to determine when storage auto scaling is required?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Perform load balancing to distribute load across different resources.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Load balancing can help to distribute the load across different resources but it is not necessary to determine when storage auto scaling is required.\"},{\"answer\": \"Analyze historical workload to forecast future load for the next two days.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Predictive auto scaling can use machine learning to analyze historical workloads and forecast future load for the next two days in order to determine when storage auto scaling is required.\"},{\"answer\": \"Determine the number of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"Determining the number of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group does not necessarily determine when storage auto scaling is required.\"},{\"answer\": \"Calculate the number of instances that are required to meet the request rate.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Little's Law can be used to calculate the number of instances that are required to meet the request rate in order to determine when storage auto scaling is required.\"}]}", "docs": ["('REL07-BP02 Obtain resources upon detection of impairment to a workload - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_adapt_to_changes_reactive_adapt_auto.html')", "('REL07-BP03 Obtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_adapt_to_changes_proactive_adapt_auto.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A research institution wants to perform data analysis on a large dataset using AWS compute resources.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 1: Design cost-optimized storage solutions", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Managing S3 object lifecycles", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

This ensures that when workloads or workload components are no longer required, they can be decommissioned or modified. This is especially useful when you release new services or features. The existing workloads and components may appear to be in use, but should be decommissioned to redirect customers to the new service. Notice previous stages of workloads \u2014 after a workload is in production, previous environments can be decommissioned or greatly reduced in capacity until they are required again.AWS provides a number of management and governance services you can use for entity lifecycle tracking. You can use AWS Config or AWS Systems Manager to provide a detailed inventory of your AWS resources and configuration. It is recommended that you integrate with your existing project or asset management systems to keep track of active projects and products within your organization. Combining your current system with the rich set of events and metrics provided by AWS allows you to build a view of significant lifecycle events and proactively manage resources to reduce unnecessary costs.Refer to the Well-Architected Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper for more details on implementing entity lifecycle tracking.Implementation stepsPerform workload reviews: As defined by your organizational policies, audit your existing projects. The amount of effort spent in the audit should be proportional to the approximate risk, value, or cost to the organization. Key areas to include in the audit would be risk to the organization of an incident or outage, value, or contribution to the organization (measured in revenue or brand reputation), cost of the workload (measured as total cost of resources and operational costs), and usage of the workload (measured in number of organization outcomes per unit of time).

Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage systems. Select from object, block, and file storage services as well as cloud data migration options for your workload.In AWS, storage is available in three forms: object, block, and file:Object Storage provides a scalable, durable platform to make data accessible from any internet location for user-generated content, active archive, serverless computing, Big Data storage or backup and recovery. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.Block Storage provides highly available, consistent, low-latency block storage for each virtual host and is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by EC2 instances that helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and cost.File Storage provides access to a shared file system across multiple systems. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories. Amazon FSx makes it easy and cost effective to launch and run popular file systems so you can leverage the rich feature sets and fast performance of widely used open source and commercially-licensed file systems.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When you select a storage solution, ensuring that it aligns with your access patterns will be critical to achieving the performance you want.PERF 3: How do you select your storage solution?The optimal storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of access method (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and enable different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your workload, and the resources required to use it. Understand your data, and use storage technologies and configurations that best support the business value of the data and how it\u2019s used.

Increase storage efficiency by choosing object storage over block storage. Configure the storage options you choose to match your data access patterns.How you access data impacts how the storage solution performs. Select the storage solution that aligns best to your access patterns, or consider changing your access patterns to align with the storage solution to maximize performance.Creating a RAID 0 array allows you to achieve a higher level of performance for a file system than what you can provision on a single volume. Consider using RAID 0 when I/O performance is more important than fault tolerance. For example, you could use it with a heavily used database where data replication is already set up separately.Select appropriate storage metrics for your workload across all of the storage options consumed for the workload. When using filesystems that use burst credits, create alarms to let you know when you are approaching those credit limits. You must create storage dashboards to show the overall workload storage health.For storage systems that are a fixed size, such as Amazon EBS or Amazon FSx, ensure that you are monitoring the amount of storage used versus the overall storage size and create automation if possible to increase the storage size when reaching a thresholdCommon anti-patterns:You assume that storage performance is adequate if customers are not complaining.You only use one tier of storage, assuming all workloads fit within that tier.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and historical reference to optimize performance and resource utilization. You can create automatic dashboards and data with one-second granularity to perform metric math on your data and derive operational and utilization insights for your storage needs.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowOptimize your storage usage and access patterns: Choose storage systems based on your workload's access patterns and the characteristics of the available storage options. Determine the best place to store data that will enable you to meet your requirements while reducing overhead. Use performance optimizations and access patterns when configuring and interacting with data based on the characteristics of your storage (for example, striping volumes or partitioning data).Select appropriate metrics for storage options: Ensure that you select the appropriate storage metrics for the workload. Each storage option offers various metrics to track how your workload performs over time. Ensure that you are measuring against any storage burst metrics (for example, monitoring burst credits for Amazon EFS). For storage systems that are fixed sized, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store or Amazon FSx, ensure that you are monitoring the amount of storage used versus the overall storage size. Create automation when possible to increase the storage size when reaching a threshold.Monitor metrics: Amazon CloudWatch can collect metrics across the resources in your architecture. You can also collect and publish custom metrics to surface business or derived metrics. Use CloudWatch or third-party solutions to set alarms that indicate when thresholds are breached.Related documents:Amazon EBS Volume TypesAmazon EC2 StorageAmazon EFS: Amazon EFS PerformanceAmazon FSx for Lustre PerformanceAmazon FSx for Windows File Server PerformanceAmazon Glacier: Amazon Glacier DocumentationAmazon S3: Request Rate and Performance ConsiderationsCloud Storage with AWSEBS I/O CharacteristicsMonitoring and understanding Amazon EBS performance using Amazon CloudWatchRelated videos:Deep dive on Amazon EBS (STG303-R1)Optimize your storage performance with Amazon S3 (STG343)Related examples:Amazon EFS CSI DriverAmazon EBS CSI DriverAmazon EFS UtilitiesAmazon EBS AutoscaleAmazon S3 Examples\n* Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your workload.

Aspects including the duration for which you retain data, data destruction processes, data access management, data transformation, and data sharing should be considered. When choosing a data classification methodology, balance usability versus access. You should also accommodate the multiple levels of access and nuances for implementing a secure, but still usable, approach for each level. Always use a defense in depth approach and reduce human access to data and mechanisms for transforming, deleting, or copying data. For example, require users to strongly authenticate to an application, and give the application, rather than the users, the requisite access permission to perform action at a distance. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted network path and require access to the decryption keys. Use tools, such as dashboards and automated reporting, to give users information from the data rather than giving them direct access to the data.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIdentify data types: Identify the types of data that you are storing or processing in your workload. That data could be text, images, binary databases, and so forth.Related documents:Data Classification WhitepaperGetting started with Amazon MacieRelated videos:Introducing the New Amazon Macie\n* Implement patterns for performing load smoothing and maintaining consistent high utilization of deployed resources to minimize the resources consumed. Components might become idle from lack of use because of changes in user behavior over time. Revise patterns and architecture to consolidate under-utilized components to increase overall utilization. Retire components that are no longer required. Understand the performance of your workload components, and optimize the components that consume the most resources. Be aware of the devices your customers use to access your services, and implement patterns to minimize the need for device upgrades.The following question focuses on these considerations for sustainability:Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your workload, and the resources required to use it. Understand your data, and use storage technologies and configurations that best support the business value of the data and how it\u2019s used. Lifecycle data to more efficient, less performant storage when requirements decrease, and delete data that\u2019s no longer required.Implement a data classification policy: Classify data to understand its significance to business outcomes. Use this information to determine when you can move data to more energy-efficient storage or safely delete it.Use technologies that support data access and storage patterns: Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your workload. For example, solid state devices (SSDs) are more energy intensive than magnetic drives and should be used only for active data use cases. Use energy-efficient, archival-class storage for infrequently accessed data.Use lifecycle policies to delete unnecessary data: Manage the lifecycle of all your data and automatically enforce deletion timelines to minimize the total storage requirements of your workload.Minimize over-provisioning in block storage: To minimize total provisioned storage, create block storage with size allocations that are appropriate for the workload. Use elastic volumes to expand storage as data grows without having to resize storage attached to compute resources. Regularly review elastic volumes and shrink over-provisioned volumes to fit the current data size.Remove unneeded or redundant data: Duplicate data only when necessary to minimize total storage consumed. Use backup technologies that deduplicate data at the file and block level. Limit the use of Redundant Array of Independent Drives (RAID) configurations except where required to meet SLAs.Use shared file systems or object storage to access common data: Adopt shared storage and single sources of truth to avoid data duplication and reduce the total storage requirements of your workload. Fetch data from shared storage only as needed. Detach unused volumes to free resources. Minimize data movement across networks: Use shared storage and access data from regional data stores to minimize the total networking resources required to support data movement for your workload.Back up data only when difficult to recreate: To minimize storage consumption, only back up data that has business value or is required to satisfy compliance requirements.

For example, a reporting process might take five hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over time.A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to reduce costs. For example, rather than maintaining servers to deliver email, you can use a service that charges on a per-message basis.AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs. On-DemandInstances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer savings of up to 75% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. With Spot Instances, you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and offer savings of up to 90% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are appropriate where the system can tolerate using a \ufb02eet of servers where individual servers can come and go dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or when using HPC and big data.Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs; such as CloudFront to minimize data transfer, or completely eliminate costs, such as utilizing Amazon Aurora on RDS to remove expensive database licensing costs.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.By factoring in cost during service selection, and using tools such as Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to regularly review your AWS usage, you can actively monitor your utilization and adjust your deployments accordingly.COST 5: How do you evaluate cost when you select services?Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.COST 6: How do you meet cost targets when you select resource type, size and number?Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.COST 7: How do you use pricing models to reduce cost?Use the pricing model that is most appropriate for your resources to minimize expense.COST 8: How do you plan for data transfer charges?Ensure that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make architectural decisions to minimize costs. A small yet effective architectural change can drastically reduce your operational costs over time.\n* Workloads often have cost requirements for operation. Use internal cost controls to select resource types and sizes based on predicted resource need.Determine which workload components could be replaced with fully managed services, such as managed databases, in-memory caches, and ETL services. Reducing your operational workload allows you to focus resources on business outcomes.For cost requirement best practices, refer to the Cost-Effective Resources section of the Cost Optimization Pillar whitepaper.Common anti-patterns:You only use one family of instances.You do not evaluate licensed solutions versus open-source solutionsYou only use block storage.You deploy common software on EC2 instances and Amazon EBS or ephemeral volumes that are available as a managed service.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Considering cost when making your selections will allow you to enable other investments.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumOptimize workload components to reduce cost: Right size workload components and enable elasticity to reduce cost and maximize component efficiency.

It eliminates the manual processes and time associated with provisioning on-premises infrastructure, including identifying hardware specifications, negotiating price quotations, managing purchase orders, scheduling shipments, and then deploying the resources. However, the ease of use and virtually unlimited on-demand capacity requires a new way of thinking about expenditures.Many businesses are composed of multiple systems run by various teams. The capability to attribute resource costs to the individual organization or product owners drives efficient usage behavior and helps reduce waste. Accurate cost attribution allows you to know which products are truly profitable, and allows you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate budget.In AWS, you create an account structure with AWS Organizations or AWS Control Tower, which provides separation and assists in allocation of your costs and usage. You can also use resource tagging to apply business and organization information to your usage and cost. Use AWS Cost Explorer for visibility into your cost and usage, or create customized dashboards and analytics with Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight. Controlling your cost and usage is done by notifications through AWS Budgets, and controls using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Service Quotas.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.You can use cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS usage and costs. When you apply tags to your AWS resources (such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets), AWS generates a cost and usage report with your usage and your tags. You can apply tags that represent organization categories (such as cost centers, workload names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.Ensure you use the right level of detail and granularity in cost and usage reporting and monitoring. For high level insights and trends, use daily granularity with AWS Cost Explorer. For deeper analysis and inspection use hourly granularity in AWS Cost Explorer, or Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight with the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) at an hourly granularity.Combining tagged resources with entity lifecycle tracking (employees, projects) makes it possible to identify orphaned resources or projects that are no longer generating value to the organization and should be decommissioned. You can set up billing alerts to notify you of predicted overspending.COST 2: How do you govern usage?Establish policies and mechanisms to ensure that appropriate costs are incurred while objectives are achieved. By employing a checks-and-balances approach, you can innovate without overspending.COST 3: How do you monitor usage and cost?Establish policies and procedures to monitor and appropriately allocate your costs. This allows you to measure and improve the cost efficiency of this workload.COST 4: How do you decommission resources?Implement change control and resource management from project inception to end-of-life. This ensures you shut down or terminate unused resources to reduce waste.\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Configure AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets inline with your organization policies.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighTo modify usage and adjust costs, each person in your organization must have access to their cost and usage information. It is recommended that all workloads and teams have the following tooling configured when they use the cloud:Reports: Summarize of all cost and usage informationNotifications: Provide notifications when cost or usage is outside of defined limits.Current State: Configure a dashboard showing current levels of cost and usage. The dashboard should be available in a highly visible place within the work environment (similar to an operations dashboard).Trending: Provide the capability to show the variability in cost and usage over the required period of time, with the required granularity.Forecasts: Provide the capability to show estimated future costs.Tracking: Show the current cost and usage against configured goals or targets.Analysis: Provide the capability for team members to perform custom and deep analysis down to the hourly granularity, with all possible dimensions.You can use AWS native tooling, such as AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and Amazon Athena with Amazon QuickSight to provide this capability. You can also use third-party tooling \u2014 however, you must ensure that the costs of this tooling provide value to your organization.Implementation stepsCreate a Cost Optimization group: Configure your account and create a group that has access to the required Cost and Usage reports. This group must include representatives from all teams that own or manage an application. This certifies that every team has access to their cost and usage information.Configure AWS Budgets: Configure AWS Budgets on all accounts for your workload. Set a budget for the overall account spend, and a budget for the workload by using tags.Configure AWS Cost Explorer: Configure AWS Cost Explorer for your workload and accounts. Create a dashboard for the workload that tracks overall spend, and key usage metrics for the workload.Configure advanced tooling: Optionally, you can create custom tooling for your organization that provides additional detail and granularity.

Regularly review the costs with configured tools or out of the box tools, do not just look at costs and categories when you receive notifications. Monitoring and analyzing costs proactively helps to identify positive trends and allows you to promote them throughout your organization.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIt is recommended to monitor cost and usage proactively within your organization, not just when there are exceptions or anomalies. Highly visible dashboards throughout your office or work environment ensure that key people have access to the information they need, and indicate the organization\u2019s focus on cost optimization. Visible dashboards allow you to actively promote successful outcomes and implement them throughout your organization.Create a daily or frequent routine to use AWS Cost Explorer or any other dashboard such as Amazon QuickSight to see the costs and analyze proactively. Analyze AWS service usage and costs at the AWS account-level, workload-level, or specific AWS service-level with grouping and filtering, and validate whether they are expected or not. Use the hourly- and resource-level granularity and tags to filter and identify incurring costs for the top resources. You can also build your own reports with the Cost Intelligence Dashboard, an Amazon QuickSight solution built by AWS Solutions Architects, and compare your budgets with the actual cost and usage.Implementation stepsReport on cost optimization: Set up a regular cycle to discuss and analyze the efficiency of the workload. Using the metrics established, report on the metrics achieved and the cost of achieving them. Identify and fix any negative trends, and identify positive trends to promote across your organization. Reporting should involve representatives from the application teams and owners, finance, and management.Create and enable daily granularity AWS Budgets for the cost and usage to take timely actions to prevent any potential cost overruns: AWS Budgets allow you to configure alert notifications, so you stay informed if any of your budget types fall out of your pre-configured thresholds. The best way to leverage AWS Budgets is to set your expected cost and usage as your limits, so that anything above your budgets can be considered overspend.Create AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for cost monitor: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses advanced Machine Learning technology to identify anomalous spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. It allows you to configure cost monitors that define spend segments you want to evaluate (for example, individual AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories), and lets you set when, where, and how you receive your alert notifications. For each monitor, attach multiple alert subscriptions for business owners and technology teams, including a name, a cost impact threshold, and alerting frequency (individual alerts, daily summary, weekly summary) for each subscription.Use AWS Cost Explorer or integrate your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data with Amazon QuickSight dashboards to visualize your organization\u2019s costs: AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. The Cost Intelligence Dashboard is a customizable and accessible dashboard to help create the foundation of your own cost management and optimization tool.Related documents:AWS BudgetsAWS Cost ExplorerDaily Cost and Usage BudgetsAWS Cost Anomaly DetectionRelated examples:Well-Architected Labs: VisualizationWell-Architected Labs: Advanced VisualizationWell-Architected Labs: Cloud Intelligence DashboardsWell-Architected Labs: Cost VisualizationAWS Cost Anomaly Detection Alert with Slack\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS cost management tools with appropriate use cases (for example, Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Report)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which AWS cost management tool should an education organization use to deliver online learning courses to students globally?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Cost Explorer\",\"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Cost Explorer is an easy-to-use interface that provides visibility into usage and costs to optimize budget and identify trends.\" },\n{\"answer\": \"Amazon QuickSight\",\"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence service that provides visualizations, but it is not a cost management tool.\" },\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Budgets\",\"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Budgets allow you to set a budget for the overall account spend and a budget for the workload, but it is not a cost management tool.\" },\n{\"answer\": \"AWS Cost and Usage Report\",\"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Cost and Usage Report provides comprehensive cost and usage information, but it is not a cost management tool.\" }\n]}", "docs": ["('COST03-BP04 Configure billing and cost management tools - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_monitor_usage_config_tools.html')", "('COST01-BP06 Monitor cost proactively - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_cloud_financial_management_proactive_process.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A financial services company wants to run a highly available and secure infrastructure to process financial transactions.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design cost-optimized compute solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Use AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as AWS Outposts, AWS Local Zones, and AWS Wavelength, to reduce network latency or improve throughput.The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones. A Region is a physical location in the world having multiple Availability Zones.Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data centerChoose the appropriate Region or Regions for your deployment based on the following key elements:Where your users are located: Choosing a Region close to your workload\u2019s users ensures lower latency when they use the workload.Where your data is located: For data-heavy applications, the major bottleneck in latency is data transfer. Application code should execute as close to the data as possible.Other constraints: Consider constraints such as security and compliance.Amazon EC2 provides placement groups for networking. A placement group is a logical grouping of instances to decrease latency or increase reliability. Using placement groups with supported instance types and an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) enables workloads to participate in a low-latency, 25 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for workloads that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. Using placement groups has the benefit of lowering jitter in network communications.Latency-sensitive services are delivered at the edge using a global network of edge locations. These edge locations commonly provide services such as content delivery network (CDN) and domain name system (DNS). By having these services at the edge, workloads can respond with low latency to requests for content or DNS resolution. These services also provide geographic services such as geo targeting of content (providing different content based on the end users\u2019 location), or latency-based routing to direct end users to the nearest Region (minimum latency).Amazon CloudFront is a global CDN that can be used to accelerate both static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content such as APIs or web applications. It relies on a global network of edge locations that will cache the content and provide high-performance network connectivity to your users. CloudFront also accelerates many other features such as content uploading and dynamic applications, making it a performance addition to all applications serving traffic over the internet. Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that will let you run code closer to users of your workload, which improves performance and reduces latency.Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service. It\u2019s designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to internet applications by translating names, like www.example.com, into numeric IP addresses, like 192.168.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6.AWS Outposts is designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency requirements, where you want that workload to run seamlessly with the rest of your other workloads in AWS. AWS Outposts are fully managed and configurable compute and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware that allow you to run compute and storage on-premises, while seamlessly connecting to the broad array of AWS services in in the cloud.AWS Local Zones is designed to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, like video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications. Local Zones allow you to gain all the benefits of having compute and storage resources closer to end-users.AWS Wavelength is designed to deliver ultra-low latency applications to 5G devices by extending AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to 5G networks. Wavelength embeds storage and compute inside telco providers 5G networks to help your 5G workload if it requires single-digit millisecond latency, such as IoT devices, game streaming, autonomous vehicles, and live media production.Use edge services to reduce latency and to enable content caching. Ensure that you have configured cache control correctly for both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS to gain the most benefit from these approaches.Common anti-patterns:You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.You chose the closest region to your location but not to the workload end user.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You must ensure that your network is available wherever you want to reach customers. Using the AWS private global network ensures that your customers get the lowest latency experience by deploying workloads into the locations nearest them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumReduce latency by selecting the correct locations: Identify where your users and data are located. Take advantage of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations to reduce latency.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n\nKnowledge Area: AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following strategies should a financial services company use to minimize latency and improve throughput when running a highly available and secure infrastructure to process financial transactions?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Consolidate all workloads into one geographic location\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is an anti-pattern and will increase latency\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Choose the closest region to the workload end user\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Choosing a region close to the workload's users will ensure lower latency when they use the workload.\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Deploy resources into the nearest Region with the lowest latency\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"The workload end user should be considered first when selecting a region to minimize latency\"}, \n{\"answer\": \"Deploy resources into multiple AWS Regions\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Deploying resources into multiple AWS Regions is a good strategy, but not the only one.

For example, a reporting process might take five hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over time.A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to reduce costs. For example, rather than maintaining servers to deliver email, you can use a service that charges on a per-message basis.AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs. On-DemandInstances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer savings of up to 75% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. With Spot Instances, you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and offer savings of up to 90% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are appropriate where the system can tolerate using a \ufb02eet of servers where individual servers can come and go dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or when using HPC and big data.Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs; such as CloudFront to minimize data transfer, or completely eliminate costs, such as utilizing Amazon Aurora on RDS to remove expensive database licensing costs.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.By factoring in cost during service selection, and using tools such as Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to regularly review your AWS usage, you can actively monitor your utilization and adjust your deployments accordingly.COST 5: How do you evaluate cost when you select services?Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.COST 6: How do you meet cost targets when you select resource type, size and number?Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.COST 7: How do you use pricing models to reduce cost?Use the pricing model that is most appropriate for your resources to minimize expense.COST 8: How do you plan for data transfer charges?Ensure that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make architectural decisions to minimize costs. A small yet effective architectural change can drastically reduce your operational costs over time.\n* Permanently running resources should utilize reserved capacity such as Savings Plans or Reserved Instances. Short-term capacity is configured to use Spot Instances, or Spot Fleet. On-Demand Instances are only used for short-term workloads that cannot be interrupted and do not run long enough for reserved capacity, between 25% to 75% of the period, depending on the resource type.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowConsider the requirements of the workload components and understand the potential pricing models. Define the availability requirement of the component. Determine if there are multiple independent resources that perform the function in the workload, and what the workload requirements are over time. Compare the cost of the resources using the default On-Demand pricing model and other applicable models. Factor in any potential changes in resources or workload components.Implementation stepsImplement pricing models: Using your analysis results, purchase Savings Plans (SPs), Reserved Instances (RIs) or implement Spot Instances. If it is your first RI purchase then choose the top 5 or 10 recommendations in the list, then monitor and analyze the results over the next month or two. Purchase small numbers of commitment discounts regular cycles, for example every two weeks or monthly.

Your workload must operate reliably despite data loss or latency over these networks. Components of the distributed system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or the workload. These best practices enable workloads to withstand stresses or failures, more quickly recover from them, and mitigate the impact of such impairments. The result is improved mean time to recovery (MTTR).Best practices\n* Distributed systems rely on communications networks to interconnect components, such as servers or services. Your workload must operate reliably despite data loss or latency in these networks. Components of the distributed system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or the workload. These best practices prevent failures and improve mean time between failures (MTBF).Best practices\n* The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* Compute resources in your workload require multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal threats. Compute resources include EC2 instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database services, IoT devices, and more.Best practices\n* The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.Best practices\n* Optimize resources provided to team members to minimize the sustainability impact while supporting their needs. For example, perform complex operations, such as rendering and compilation, on highly utilized shared cloud desktops instead of on underutilized high-powered single-user systems.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowProvision workstations and other devices to align with how they\u2019re used.Use virtual desktops and application streaming to limit upgrade and device requirements.Move processor or memory-intensive tasks to the cloud.Evaluate the impact of processes and systems on your device lifecycle, and select solutions that minimize the requirement for device replacement while satisfying business requirements.Implement remote management for devices to reduce required business travel.Related documents:What is Amazon WorkSpaces?Amazon AppStream 2.0 DocumentationNICE DCVAWS Systems Manager Fleet ManagerRelated videos:Building Sustainably on AWS\n* Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can be a source of high-power consumption, and many GPU workloads are highly variable, such as rendering, transcoding, and machine learning training and modeling. Only run GPU instances for the time needed, and decommission them with automation when not required to minimize resources consumed.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowUse GPUs only for tasks where they\u2019re more efficient than CPU-based alternatives.Use automation to release GPU instances when not in use.Use flexible graphics acceleration rather than dedicated GPU instances.Take advantage of custom-purpose hardware that is specific to your workload.Related documents:Accelerated ComputingAWS InferentiaAWS TrainiumAccelerated Computing for EC2 InstancesAmazon EC2 VT1 InstancesAmazon Elastic Graphics\n* A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in time.Best practices\n* There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:Democratize advanced technologies: Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor. Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting and running a new technology, consider consuming the technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume, allowing your team to focus on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.Go global in minutes: Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.Use serverless architectures: Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.Consider mechanical sympathy: Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.\n\nKnowledge Area: Distributed compute strategies (for example, edge processing)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"What would be the best practice to ensure the healthcare company's workload operates reliably despite data loss or latency over communications networks?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Implement remote management for devices to reduce required business travel\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"This best practice does not address data loss or latency over communications networks.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Optimize resources provided to team members to minimize the sustainability impact while supporting their needs\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"This best practice does not address data loss or latency over communications networks.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Components of the distributed system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or the workload\",\"is_correct\": \"True\", \"explanation\": \"This best practice will enable the workload to withstand stresses or failures, more quickly recover from them, and mitigate the impact of such impairments.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use GPUs only for tasks where they're more efficient than CPU-based alternatives\",\"is_correct\": \"False\", \"explanation\": \"This best practice does not address data loss or latency over communications networks.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('REL 5\\xa0 How do you design interactions in a distributed system to mitigate or withstand failures? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-05.html')", "('REL 4\\xa0 How do you design interactions in a distributed system to prevent failures? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-04.html')", "('PERF 2\\xa0 How do you select your compute solution? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-02.html')", "('SEC 6\\xa0 How do you protect your compute resources? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-06.html')", "('PERF 5\\xa0 How do you configure your networking solution? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-05.html')", "('SUS02-BP05 Optimize team member resources for activities performed - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_user_a6.html')", "('SUS05-BP04 Optimize your use of GPUs - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus_sus_hardware_a5.html')", "('REL 7\\xa0 How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in demand? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-07.html')", "('Design principles - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-dp.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to build a mobile application that needs to access and store data in the cloud.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design cost-optimized compute solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Hybrid compute options (for example, AWS Outposts, AWS Snowball Edge)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

You can also accelerate your time to market when you deploy new services and features.Common anti-patterns:In a post-migration workload, using the same compute solution that was being used on premises.Lacking awareness of the cloud compute solutions and how those solutions might improve your compute performance.Oversizing an existing compute solution to meet scaling or performance requirements, when an alternative compute solution would align to your workload characteristics more precisely.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By identifying the compute requirements and evaluating the available compute solutions, business stakeholders and engineering teams will understand the benefits and limitations of using the selected compute solution. The selected compute solution should fit the workload performance criteria. Key criteria include processing needs, traffic patterns, data access patterns, scaling needs, and latency requirements.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUnderstand the virtualization, containerization, and management solutions that can benefit your workload and meet your performance requirements. A workload can contain multiple types of compute solutions. Each compute solution has differing characteristics. Based on your workload scale and compute requirements, a compute solution can be selected and configured to meet your needs. The cloud architect should learn the advantages and disadvantages of instances, containers, and functions. The following steps will help you through how to select your compute solution to match your workload characteristics and performance requirements.Implementation steps:Select the location of where the compute solution must reside by evaluating PERF05-BP06 Choose your workload\u2019s location based on network requirements. This location will limit the types of compute solution available to you.Identify the type of compute solution that works with the location requirement and application requirementsAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) virtual server instances come in a wide variety of different families and sizes. They offer a wide variety of capabilities, including solid state drives (SSDs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). EC2 instances offer the greatest flexibility on instance choice. When you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware of your instance. Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities. Instance types are grouped in instance families based on these capabilities. Typical use cases include: running enterprise applications, high performance computing (HPC), training and deploying machine learning applications and running cloud native applications.Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to automatically run and manage containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or serverless instances using AWS Fargate. You can use Amazon ECS with other services such as Amazon Route 53, Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon ECS is recommended if your application is containerized and your engineering team prefers Docker containers.Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service. You can choose to run your EKS clusters using AWS Fargate, removing the need to provision and manage servers. Managing Amazon EKS is simplified due to integrations with AWS Services such as Amazon CloudWatch, Auto Scaling Groups, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). When using containers, you must use compute metrics to select the optimal type for your workload, similar to how you use compute metrics to select your EC2 or AWS Fargate instance types. Amazon EKS is recommended if your application is containerized and your engineering team prefers Kubernetes over Docker containers.You can use AWS Lambda to run code that supports the allowed runtime, memory, and CPU options. Simply upload your code, and AWS Lambda will manage everything required to run and scale that code. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly. Lambda is recommended for short running, microservice architectures developed for the cloud.After you have experimented with your new compute solution, plan your migration and validate your performance metrics. This is a continual process, see PERF02-BP04 Determine the required configuration by right-sizing.Level of effort for the implementation plan: If a workload is moving from one compute solution to another, there could be a moderate level of effort involved in refactoring the application.Related documents:Cloud Compute with AWSEC2 Instance TypesProcessor State Control for Your EC2 InstanceEKS Containers: EKS Worker NodesAmazon ECS Containers: Amazon ECS Container InstancesFunctions: Lambda Function ConfigurationPrescriptive Guidance for ContainersPrescriptive Guidance for ServerlessRelated videos:How to choose compute option for startupsOptimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Amazon EC2 foundations (CMP211-R2)Powering next-gen Amazon EC2: Deep dive into the Nitro systemDeliver high-performance ML inference with AWS Inferentia (CMP324-R1)Better, faster, cheaper compute: Cost-optimizing Amazon EC2 (CMP202-R1)Related examples:Migrating the web application to containersRun a Serverless Hello WorldTypeServerContainersFunctionAWS serviceAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)AWS LambdaKey CharacteristicsHas dedicated option for hardware license requirements, Placement Options, and a large selection of different instance families based on compute metricsEasy deployment, consistent environments, runs on top of EC2 instances, ScalableShort runtime (15 minutes or less), maximum memory and CPU are not as high as other services, Managed hardware layer, Scales to millions of concurrent requestsCommon use-casesLift and shift migrations, monolithic application, hybrid environments, enterprise applicationsMicroservices, hybrid environments,Microservices, event-driven applications\n\nKnowledge Area: Hybrid compute options (for example, AWS Outposts, AWS Snowball Edge)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which compute option should the company use to build a mobile application that needs to access and store data in the cloud?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"EC2 is a virtual server instance which offers flexibility on instance choice but is not well suited for mobile applications that need to access data in the cloud.\"},{\"answer\": \"Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows containers to be automatically run and managed on a cluster of EC2 instances or serverless instances, making it ideal for a mobile application that needs to access data in the cloud.\"},{\"answer\": \"Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service, and while it is suitable for containerized applications, it is not the best choice for applications that need to access data in the cloud.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Lambda\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Lambda is recommended for short running, microservice architectures developed for the cloud, but it is not the best choice for a mobile application that needs to access data in the cloud.\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF02-BP01 Evaluate the available compute options - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_compute_evaluate_options.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A manufacturing company wants to use AWS to optimize their supply chain and production processes.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design cost-optimized compute solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Instance types, families, and sizes (for example, memory optimized, compute optimized, virtualization)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Use this data to choose resources that best match your workload's profile. For example, a memory-intensive workload, such as a database, could be served best by the r-family of instances. However, a bursting workload can benefit more from an elastic container system.Common anti-patterns:You choose the largest instance available for all workloads.You standardize all instances types to one type for ease of management.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Being familiar with the AWS compute offerings allows you to determine the correct solution for your various workloads. After you have selected the various compute offerings for your workload, you have the agility to quickly experiment with those compute offerings to determine which ones meet the needs of your workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumModify your workload configuration by right sizing: To optimize both performance and overall efficiency, determine which resources your workload needs. Choose memory-optimized instances for systems that require more memory than CPU, or compute-optimized instances for components that do data processing that is not memory-intensive.

Evaluate your workload's needs by comparing the available resources with these requirements and make changes to your compute environment to best match your workload's profile. For example, over time a system might be observed to be more memory-intensive than initially thought, so moving to a different instance family or size could improve both performance and efficiency.Common anti-patterns:You only monitor system-level metrics to gain insight into your workload.You architect your compute needs for peak workload requirements.You oversize the compute solution to meet scaling or performance requirements when moving to a new compute solution would match your workload characteristicsBenefits of establishing this best practice: To optimize performance and resource utilization, you need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and a historical reference. You can create automatic dashboards to visualize this data and perform metric math to derive operational and utilization insights.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowUse a data-driven approach to optimize resources: To achieve maximum performance and efficiency, use the data gathered over time from your workload to tune and optimize your resources. Look at the trends in your workload's usage of current resources and determine where you can make changes to better match your workload's needs. When resources are over-committed, system performance degrades, whereas underutilization results in a less efficient use of resources and higher cost.Related documents:Cloud Compute with AWSAWS Compute OptimizerCloud Compute with AWSEC2 Instance TypesECS Containers: Amazon ECS Container InstancesEKS Containers: EKS Worker NodesFunctions: Lambda Function ConfigurationProcessor State Control for Your EC2 InstanceRelated videos:Amazon EC2 foundations (CMP211-R2)Better, faster, cheaper compute: Cost-optimizing Amazon EC2 (CMP202-R1)Deliver high performance ML inference with AWS Inferentia (CMP324-R1)Optimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Powering next-gen Amazon EC2: Deep dive into the Nitro systemRelated examples:Rightsizing with Compute Optimizer and Memory utilization enabledAWS Compute Optimizer Demo code\n\nKnowledge Area: Optimization of compute utilization (for example, containers, serverless computing, microservices)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following techniques is the best way to optimize compute utilization for a company's disaster recovery plan on AWS?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Monitor system-level metrics to gain insight into the workload\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Monitoring system-level metrics is important, but is not the best way to optimize compute utilization for a company's disaster recovery plan on AWS.\"},{\"answer\": \"Architect your compute needs for peak workload requirements\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Architecting your compute needs for peak workload requirements is not the best way to optimize compute utilization for a company's disaster recovery plan on AWS.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Use the data gathered over time from the workload to tune and optimize resources\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"Using the data gathered over time from the workload to tune and optimize resources is the best way to optimize compute utilization for a company's disaster recovery plan on AWS.\"},{\"answer\": \"Oversize the compute solution to meet scaling or performance requirements\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Oversizing the compute solution to meet scaling or performance requirements is not the best way to optimize compute utilization for a company's disaster recovery plan on AWS.\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF02-BP06 Re-evaluate compute needs based on metrics - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_compute_use_metrics.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A healthcare company wants to store and process sensitive patient information in the cloud.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design cost-optimized compute solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "Scaling strategies (for example, auto scaling, hibernation)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

You can take advantage of elasticity in the cloud to automatically scale capacity during and after user load spikes to make sure you are only using the exact number of resources needed to meet the needs of your customers.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumElasticity matches the supply of resources you have against the demand for those resources. Instances, containers, and functions provide mechanisms for elasticity, either in combination with automatic scaling or as a feature of the service.

If you are deploying a video transcoding application, 100% CPU utilization is expected and should not be your primary metric. You can use a customized metric (such as memory utilization) for your scaling policy if required. To choose the right metrics, consider the following guidance for Amazon EC2:The metric should be a valid utilization metric and describe how busy an instance is.The metric value must increase or decrease proportionally to the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group.Use dynamic scaling instead of manual scaling for your Auto Scaling group. We also recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies in your dynamic scaling.Verify that workload deployments can handle both scale-up and scale-down events. Create test scenarios for scale-down events to ensure that the workload behaves as expected. You can use Activity history to test and verify a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group.Evaluate your workload for predictable patterns and proactively scale as you anticipate predicted and planned changes in demand.

If using Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon ECS clusters, you can configure automatic scaling of these to occur based on usage metrics that correspond to demand for your workload. For Amazon EC2, average CPU utilization, load balancer request count, or network bandwidth can be used to scale out (or scale in) EC2 instances. For Amazon ECS, average CPU utilization, load balancer request count, and memory utilization can be used to scale out (or scale in) ECS tasks. Using Target Auto Scaling on AWS, the autoscaler acts like a household thermostat, adding or removing resources to maintain the target value (for example, 70% CPU utilization) that you specify.AWS Auto Scaling can also do Predictive Auto Scaling, which uses machine learning to analyze each resource's historical workload and regularly forecasts the future load for the next two days.Little\u2019s Law helps calculate how many instances of compute (EC2 instances, concurrent Lambda functions, etc.) that you need.L = \u03bbWL = number of instances (or mean concurrency in the system)\u03bb = mean rate at which requests arrive (req/sec)W = mean time that each request spends in the system (sec)For example, at 100 rps, if each request takes 0.5 seconds to process, you will need 50 instances to keep up with demand.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumObtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload.

You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.When implementing a scale-out architecture where you want to use multiple instances for service content, you can use load balancers inside your Amazon VPC. AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the ELB service. Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.Common anti-patterns:You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.Benefits of establishing this best practice: A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone, or across multiple Availability Zones. Load balancers feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse the appropriate load balancer for your workload: Select the appropriate load balancer for your workload. If you must load balance HTTP requests, we recommend Application Load Balancer. For network and transport protocols (layer 4 \u2013 TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance and low latency applications, we recommend Network Load Balancer. Application Load Balancers support HTTPS and Network Load Balancers support TLS encryption offloading.Enable offload of HTTPS or TLS encryption: Elastic Load Balancing includes integrated certificate management, user-authentication, and SSL/TLS decryption. It provides the flexibility to centrally manage TLS settings and offload CPU intensive workloads from your applications.

To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users. AWS Shield provides automatic protection against these attacks at no extra cost for AWS service endpoints on your workload. You can augment these features with virtual appliances from APN Partners and the AWS Marketplace to meet your needs.Common anti-patterns:Using public internet addresses on instances or containers and managing the connectivity to them via DNS.Using Internet Protocol addresses instead of domain names for locating services.Providing content (web pages, static assets, media files) to a large geographic area and not using a content delivery network.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By implementing highly available services in your workload, you know that your workload will be available to your users.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnsure that you have highly available connectivity for users of the workload Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public facing endpoints.

Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves your data between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on your usage patterns.Implementation stepsConfigure workload metrics: Ensure you capture the key metrics for the workload. These metrics provide an indication of the customer experience, such as the workload output, and align to the differences between resource types and sizes, such as CPU and memory usage.View rightsizing recommendations: Use the rightsizing recommendations in AWS Compute Optimizer to make adjustments to your workload.Select resource type and size automatically based on metrics: Using the workload metrics, manually or automatically select your workload resources. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling or implementing code within your application can reduce the effort required if frequent changes are needed, and it can potentially implement changes sooner than a manual process.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Compute OptimizerAmazon CloudWatch featuresCloudWatch Getting Set UpCloudWatch Publishing Custom MetricsCost Optimization: Amazon EC2 Right SizingGetting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringLaunch an EC2 Instance Using the SDK\n* Identify periods of low or no utilization and scale down resources to eliminate excess capacity and improve efficiency.Common anti-patterns:You do not scale your infrastructure with user load.You manually scale your infrastructure all the time.You leave increased capacity after a scaling event instead of scaling back down.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Configuring and testing workload elasticity will help reduce workload environmental impact, save money, and maintain performance benchmarks.

When evaluating compute options, be aware of your requirements for workload performance and cost requirements and use this to make informed decisions.In AWS, compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions:Instances are virtualized servers, allowing you to change their capabilities with a button or an API call. Because resource decisions in the cloud aren\u2019t fixed, you can experiment with different server types. At AWS, these virtual server instances come in different families and sizes, and they offer a wide variety of capabilities, including solid-state drives (SSDs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes. AWS Fargate is serverless compute for containers or Amazon EC2 can be used if you need control over the installation, configuration, and management of your compute environment. You can also choose from multiple container orchestration platforms: Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).Functions abstract the execution environment from the code you want to execute. For example, AWS Lambda allows you to execute code without running an instance.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.When architecting your use of compute you should take advantage of the elasticity mechanisms available to ensure you have sufficient capacity to sustain performance as demand changes.PERF 2: How do you select your compute solution?The optimal compute solution for a workload varies based on application design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use different compute solutions for various components and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency.\n* Using the appropriate instances and resources for your workload is key to cost savings. For example, a reporting process might take five hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over time.A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to reduce costs. For example, rather than maintaining servers to deliver email, you can use a service that charges on a per-message basis.AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs. On-DemandInstances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer savings of up to 75% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. With Spot Instances, you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and offer savings of up to 90% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are appropriate where the system can tolerate using a \ufb02eet of servers where individual servers can come and go dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or when using HPC and big data.Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs; such as CloudFront to minimize data transfer, or completely eliminate costs, such as utilizing Amazon Aurora on RDS to remove expensive database licensing costs.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.By factoring in cost during service selection, and using tools such as Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to regularly review your AWS usage, you can actively monitor your utilization and adjust your deployments accordingly.COST 5: How do you evaluate cost when you select services?Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.COST 6: How do you meet cost targets when you select resource type, size and number?Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.COST 7: How do you use pricing models to reduce cost?Use the pricing model that is most appropriate for your resources to minimize expense.COST 8: How do you plan for data transfer charges?Ensure that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make architectural decisions to minimize costs. A small yet effective architectural change can drastically reduce your operational costs over time.\n* Factor in cost when selecting all components. This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES. These services remove the need for you to manage a resource, and provide the function of code execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.For more information on Serverless, refer to the Well-Architected Serverless Application Lens whitepaper.Implementation stepsSelect each service to optimize cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis, select each option that provides the best match with your organizational priorities.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining cost-effective AWS compute services with appropriate use cases (for example, Lambda, Amazon EC2, Fargate)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"When architecting a manufacturing company's use of AWS compute resources to optimize their supply chain and production processes, how should resources be selected to achieve the highest performance efficiency?\",\n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Use AWS Spot Instances for stateless web servers, batch processing, or High Performance Computing and Big Data workloads\",\"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Spot Instances can reduce cost, but may result in reduced performance since instances can come and go dynamically.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use Amazon EC2 Instances with SSDs and GPUs to meet workload performance requirements\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"EC2 Instances can meet performance requirements, but may not provide the most cost-effective solution.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use Amazon Fargate or Amazon EC2 to run applications, their dependencies, and manage compute environments\",\"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"Using Fargate or EC2 to run applications and manage compute environments can provide the most cost-effective solution while meeting performance requirements.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use AWS Lambda to execute the code without running an instance\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"Lambda can abstract the execution environment from the code, but may not meet performance requirements for the workload.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('Compute - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-compute.html')", "('Cost-effective resources - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cereso.html')", "('COST05-BP05 Select components of this workload to optimize cost in line with organization priorities - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_select_service_select_for_cost.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A financial services company wants to run a highly available and secure infrastructure to process financial transactions.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design cost-optimized compute solutions", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Determining the required availability for different classes of workloads (for example, production workloads, non-production workloads)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Some services or features are more cost effective at different usage levels. By performing the analysis on each component over time and at projected usage, the workload remains cost-effective over its lifetime.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAs AWS releases new services and features, the optimal services for your workload may change. Effort required should reflect potential benefits. Workload review frequency depends on your organization requirements. If it is a workload of significant cost, implementing new services sooner will maximize cost savings, so more frequent review can be advantageous. Another trigger for review is change in usage patterns. Significant changes in usage can indicate that alternate services would be more optimal. For example, for higher data transfer rates a direct connect service may be cheaper than a VPN, and provide the required connectivity. Predict the potential impact of service changes, so you can monitor for these usage level triggers and implement the most cost-effective services sooner.Implementation stepsDefine predicted usage patterns: Working with your organization, such as marketing and product owners, document what the expected and predicted usage patterns will be for the workload.Perform cost analysis at predicted usage: Using the usage patterns defined, perform the analysis at each of these points. The analysis effort should reflect the potential outcome. For example, if the change in usage is large, a thorough analysis should be performed to verify any costs and changes.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n* Select resource size or type based on data about the workload and resource characteristics. For example, compute, memory, throughput, or write intensive.

Combined with compute-related metrics, a workload can automatically respond to changes and use the optimal set of resources to achieve its goal.Optimally matching supply to demand delivers the lowest cost for a workload, but you also must plan for sufficient supply to allow for provisioning time and individual resource failures. Demand can be fixed or variable, requiring metrics and automation to ensure that management does not become a burdensome and disproportionately large cost.With AWS, you can use a number of different approaches to match supply with demand. The Cost Optimization Pillar whitepaper describes how to use the following approaches to cost:Demand-based approachBuffer-based approachTime-based approachYou must ensure that workload deployments can handle both scale-up and scale-down events. Create test scenarios for scale-down events to ensure that the workload behaves as expected.Common anti-patterns:You react to alarms by manually increasing capacity.You leave increased capacity after a scaling event instead of scaling back down.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Configuring and testing workload elasticity will help save money, maintain performance benchmarks, and improves reliability as traffic changes. Most non-production instances should be stopped when they are not being used. Although it's possible to manually shut down unused instances, this is impractical at larger scales. You can also take advantage of volume-based elasticity, which allows you to optimize performance and cost by automatically increasing the number of compute instances during demand spikes and decreasing capacity when demand decreases.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumTake advantage of elasticity: Elasticity matches the supply of resources you have against the demand for those resources. Instances, containers, and functions provide mechanisms for elasticity either in combination with automatic scaling or as a feature of the service. Use elasticity in your architecture to ensure that you have sufficient capacity to meet performance requirements at all scales of use. Ensure that the metrics for scaling up or down elastic resources are validated against the type of workload being deployed. If you are deploying a video transcoding application, 100% CPU utilization is expected and should not be your primary metric. Alternatively, you can measure against the queue depth of transcoding jobs waiting to scale your instance types. Ensure that workload deployments can handle both scale up and scale down events. Scaling down workload components safely is as critical as scaling up resources when demand dictates. Create test scenarios for scale-down events to ensure that the workload behaves as expected.Related documents:Cloud Compute with AWSEC2 Instance TypesECS Containers: Amazon ECS Container InstancesEKS Containers: EKS Worker NodesFunctions: Lambda Function ConfigurationProcessor State Control for Your EC2 InstanceRelated videos:Amazon EC2 foundations (CMP211-R2)Better, faster, cheaper compute: Cost-optimizing Amazon EC2 (CMP202-R1)Deliver high performance ML inference with AWS Inferentia (CMP324-R1)Optimize performance and cost for your AWS compute (CMP323-R1)Powering next-gen Amazon EC2: Deep dive into the Nitro systemRelated examples:Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group ExamplesAmazon EFS Tutorials\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining the required availability for different classes of workloads (for example, production workloads, non-production workloads)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following best practices should be established to ensure that the financial services company's infrastructure remains cost-effective over its lifetime?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Use the AWS TCO Calculator to predict usage patterns.\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"The TCO Calculator is used to compare cost models between cloud and on-premises infrastructure, not to predict usage patterns.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Perform cost analysis at predicted usage levels.\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"By performing the analysis on each component over time and at projected usage, the workload remains cost-effective over its lifetime.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Select resource size or type based on the workload's expected usage.\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Selecting resource sizes or types should be based on data about the workload and resource characteristics, not on the expected usage.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Configure and test workload elasticity.\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Configuring and testing workload elasticity will help save money, maintain performance benchmarks, and improve reliability, but is not required for cost-effectiveness.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('COST05-BP06 Perform cost analysis for different usage over time - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_select_service_analyze_over_time.html')", "('COST06-BP02 Select resource type, size, and number based on data - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_type_size_number_resources_data.html')", "('PERF02-BP05 Use the available elasticity of resources - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_compute_elasticity.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to store log files from their applications for analysis and compliance purposes.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 2: Design cost-optimized compute solutions", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Selecting the appropriate instance family for a workload", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Appropriately provision throughput, sizing, and storage for services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (PIOPS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EMR, and networking. This can be done with a feedback loop such as automatic scaling or by custom code in the workload.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowCreate a feedback loop within the workload that uses active metrics from the running workload to make changes to that workload. You can use a managed service, such as AWS Auto Scaling, which you configure to perform the right sizing operations for you. AWS also provides APIs, SDKs, and features that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. You can program a workload to stop-and-start an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance to allow a change of instance size or instance type. This provides the benefits of right-sizing while removing almost all the operational cost required to make the change.Some AWS services have built in automatic type or size selection, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) Intelligent-Tiering. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves your data between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on your usage patterns.Implementation stepsConfigure workload metrics: Ensure you capture the key metrics for the workload. These metrics provide an indication of the customer experience, such as the workload output, and align to the differences between resource types and sizes, such as CPU and memory usage.View rightsizing recommendations: Use the rightsizing recommendations in AWS Compute Optimizer to make adjustments to your workload.Select resource type and size automatically based on metrics: Using the workload metrics, manually or automatically select your workload resources. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling or implementing code within your application can reduce the effort required if frequent changes are needed, and it can potentially implement changes sooner than a manual process.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Compute OptimizerAmazon CloudWatch featuresCloudWatch Getting Set UpCloudWatch Publishing Custom MetricsCost Optimization: Amazon EC2 Right SizingGetting Started with Amazon EC2 Auto ScalingAmazon S3 Intelligent-TieringLaunch an EC2 Instance Using the SDK\n\nKnowledge Area: Selecting the appropriate instance size for a workload\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which approach should be used to select the appropriate instance size for a workload on AWS?\", \n\"answer_choices\": [\n    {\"answer\": \"Run a cost analysis to select the largest instance available for the workload.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"This approach is an anti-pattern as it can lead to inefficient use of resources and increse costs.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Analyze the performance characteristics of the workload and select the resource type that best matches the characteristics.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Analyzing the performance characteristics of the workload and selecting the resource type that best matches the characteristics is the correct approach for selecting the appropriate instance size for a workload on AWS.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Standardize all instances types to one type for ease of management.\",\"is_correct\": \"False\",\"explanation\": \"This approach is an anti-pattern as all workloads have different performance characteristics and may require different resource types.\"},\n    {\"answer\": \"Use metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost.\",\"is_correct\": \"True\",\"explanation\": \"Using metrics from the currently running workload to select the right size and type to optimize for cost can help optimize performance and cost when selecting the appropriate instance size for a workload on AWS.\"}\n]}", "docs": ["('COST06-BP02 Select resource type, size, and number based on data - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_type_size_number_resources_data.html')", "('PERF02-BP04 Determine the required configuration by right-sizing - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_compute_right_sizing.html')", "('COST06-BP03 Select resource type, size, and number automatically based on metrics - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_type_size_number_resources_metrics.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A manufacturing company wants to use AWS to optimize their supply chain and production processes.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Design cost-optimized database solutions", "focus": "Knowledge of", "item": "AWS cost management service features (for example, cost allocation tags, multi-account billing)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

It eliminates the manual processes and time associated with provisioning on-premises infrastructure, including identifying hardware specifications, negotiating price quotations, managing purchase orders, scheduling shipments, and then deploying the resources. However, the ease of use and virtually unlimited on-demand capacity requires a new way of thinking about expenditures.Many businesses are composed of multiple systems run by various teams. The capability to attribute resource costs to the individual organization or product owners drives efficient usage behavior and helps reduce waste. Accurate cost attribution allows you to know which products are truly profitable, and allows you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate budget.In AWS, you create an account structure with AWS Organizations or AWS Control Tower, which provides separation and assists in allocation of your costs and usage. You can also use resource tagging to apply business and organization information to your usage and cost. Use AWS Cost Explorer for visibility into your cost and usage, or create customized dashboards and analytics with Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight. Controlling your cost and usage is done by notifications through AWS Budgets, and controls using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Service Quotas.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.You can use cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS usage and costs. When you apply tags to your AWS resources (such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets), AWS generates a cost and usage report with your usage and your tags. You can apply tags that represent organization categories (such as cost centers, workload names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.Ensure you use the right level of detail and granularity in cost and usage reporting and monitoring. For high level insights and trends, use daily granularity with AWS Cost Explorer. For deeper analysis and inspection use hourly granularity in AWS Cost Explorer, or Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight with the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) at an hourly granularity.Combining tagged resources with entity lifecycle tracking (employees, projects) makes it possible to identify orphaned resources or projects that are no longer generating value to the organization and should be decommissioned. You can set up billing alerts to notify you of predicted overspending.COST 2: How do you govern usage?Establish policies and mechanisms to ensure that appropriate costs are incurred while objectives are achieved. By employing a checks-and-balances approach, you can innovate without overspending.COST 3: How do you monitor usage and cost?Establish policies and procedures to monitor and appropriately allocate your costs. This allows you to measure and improve the cost efficiency of this workload.COST 4: How do you decommission resources?Implement change control and resource management from project inception to end-of-life. This ensures you shut down or terminate unused resources to reduce waste.\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Configure AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets inline with your organization policies.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighTo modify usage and adjust costs, each person in your organization must have access to their cost and usage information. It is recommended that all workloads and teams have the following tooling configured when they use the cloud:Reports: Summarize of all cost and usage informationNotifications: Provide notifications when cost or usage is outside of defined limits.Current State: Configure a dashboard showing current levels of cost and usage. The dashboard should be available in a highly visible place within the work environment (similar to an operations dashboard).Trending: Provide the capability to show the variability in cost and usage over the required period of time, with the required granularity.Forecasts: Provide the capability to show estimated future costs.Tracking: Show the current cost and usage against configured goals or targets.Analysis: Provide the capability for team members to perform custom and deep analysis down to the hourly granularity, with all possible dimensions.You can use AWS native tooling, such as AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and Amazon Athena with Amazon QuickSight to provide this capability.

Regularly review the costs with configured tools or out of the box tools, do not just look at costs and categories when you receive notifications. Monitoring and analyzing costs proactively helps to identify positive trends and allows you to promote them throughout your organization.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIt is recommended to monitor cost and usage proactively within your organization, not just when there are exceptions or anomalies. Highly visible dashboards throughout your office or work environment ensure that key people have access to the information they need, and indicate the organization\u2019s focus on cost optimization. Visible dashboards allow you to actively promote successful outcomes and implement them throughout your organization.Create a daily or frequent routine to use AWS Cost Explorer or any other dashboard such as Amazon QuickSight to see the costs and analyze proactively. Analyze AWS service usage and costs at the AWS account-level, workload-level, or specific AWS service-level with grouping and filtering, and validate whether they are expected or not. Use the hourly- and resource-level granularity and tags to filter and identify incurring costs for the top resources. You can also build your own reports with the Cost Intelligence Dashboard, an Amazon QuickSight solution built by AWS Solutions Architects, and compare your budgets with the actual cost and usage.Implementation stepsReport on cost optimization: Set up a regular cycle to discuss and analyze the efficiency of the workload. Using the metrics established, report on the metrics achieved and the cost of achieving them. Identify and fix any negative trends, and identify positive trends to promote across your organization. Reporting should involve representatives from the application teams and owners, finance, and management.Create and enable daily granularity AWS Budgets for the cost and usage to take timely actions to prevent any potential cost overruns: AWS Budgets allow you to configure alert notifications, so you stay informed if any of your budget types fall out of your pre-configured thresholds. The best way to leverage AWS Budgets is to set your expected cost and usage as your limits, so that anything above your budgets can be considered overspend.Create AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for cost monitor: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses advanced Machine Learning technology to identify anomalous spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. It allows you to configure cost monitors that define spend segments you want to evaluate (for example, individual AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories), and lets you set when, where, and how you receive your alert notifications. For each monitor, attach multiple alert subscriptions for business owners and technology teams, including a name, a cost impact threshold, and alerting frequency (individual alerts, daily summary, weekly summary) for each subscription.Use AWS Cost Explorer or integrate your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data with Amazon QuickSight dashboards to visualize your organization\u2019s costs: AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

For example, using strategies like caching data to prevent excessive network or database calls, using read-replicas for database engines to improve read rates, sharding or compressing data where possible to reduce data volumes, and buffering and streaming of results as they are available to avoid blocking.As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes. Measure the impacts to the system and to the end-user to understand how your trade-offs impact your workload. Use a systematic approach, such as load testing, to explore whether the tradeoff improves performance.Common anti-patterns:You assume that workload performance is adequate if customers are not complaining.You only collect data on performance after you have made performance-related changes.Benefits of establishing this best practice: To optimize performance and resource utilization, you need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and historical reference.

For example, if using a key-value data store increases system performance, it is important to evaluate how the eventually consistent nature of it will impact customers.Identify areas of poor performance in your system through metrics and monitoring. Determine how you can make improvements, what trade-offs those improvements bring, and how they impact the system and the user experience. For example, implementing caching data can help dramatically improve performance but requires a clear strategy for how and when to update or invalidate cached data to prevent incorrect system behavior.Common anti-patterns:You assume that all performance gains should be implemented, even if there are tradeoffs for implementation such as eventual consistency.You only evaluate changes to workloads when a performance issue has reached a critical point.Benefits of establishing this best practice: When you are evaluating potential performance-related improvements, you must decide if the tradeoffs for the changes are consistent with the workload requirements.

Examples of storage characteristics include: shareable access, file size, growth rate, throughput, IOPS, latency, access patterns, and persistence of data. Use these characteristics to evaluate if block, file, object, or instance storage services are the most efficient solution for your storage needs.\n* Implement patterns for performing load smoothing and maintaining consistent high utilization of deployed resources to minimize the resources consumed. Components might become idle from lack of use because of changes in user behavior over time. Revise patterns and architecture to consolidate under-utilized components to increase overall utilization. Retire components that are no longer required. Understand the performance of your workload components, and optimize the components that consume the most resources. Be aware of the devices your customers use to access your services, and implement patterns to minimize the need for device upgrades.The following question focuses on these considerations for sustainability:Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your workload, and the resources required to use it. Understand your data, and use storage technologies and configurations that best support the business value of the data and how it\u2019s used. Lifecycle data to more efficient, less performant storage when requirements decrease, and delete data that\u2019s no longer required.Implement a data classification policy: Classify data to understand its significance to business outcomes. Use this information to determine when you can move data to more energy-efficient storage or safely delete it.Use technologies that support data access and storage patterns: Use storage that best supports how your data is accessed and stored to minimize the resources provisioned while supporting your workload. For example, solid state devices (SSDs) are more energy intensive than magnetic drives and should be used only for active data use cases. Use energy-efficient, archival-class storage for infrequently accessed data.Use lifecycle policies to delete unnecessary data: Manage the lifecycle of all your data and automatically enforce deletion timelines to minimize the total storage requirements of your workload.Minimize over-provisioning in block storage: To minimize total provisioned storage, create block storage with size allocations that are appropriate for the workload. Use elastic volumes to expand storage as data grows without having to resize storage attached to compute resources. Regularly review elastic volumes and shrink over-provisioned volumes to fit the current data size.Remove unneeded or redundant data: Duplicate data only when necessary to minimize total storage consumed. Use backup technologies that deduplicate data at the file and block level. Limit the use of Redundant Array of Independent Drives (RAID) configurations except where required to meet SLAs.Use shared file systems or object storage to access common data: Adopt shared storage and single sources of truth to avoid data duplication and reduce the total storage requirements of your workload. Fetch data from shared storage only as needed. Detach unused volumes to free resources. Minimize data movement across networks: Use shared storage and access data from regional data stores to minimize the total networking resources required to support data movement for your workload.Back up data only when difficult to recreate: To minimize storage consumption, only back up data that has business value or is required to satisfy compliance requirements. Examine backup policies and exclude ephemeral storage that doesn\u2019t provide value in a recovery scenario.SUS 4: How do you take advantage of data access and usage patterns to support your sustainability goals?Implement data management practices to reduce the provisioned storage required to support your workload, and the resources required to use it.

Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* Use the access patterns of the workload to decide which services and technologies to use. In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries.

For workloads with extreme resilience requirements, carefully evaluate the options for a multi-Region architecture.\n* Implement services to reduce data transfer. For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery.

You can choose from many purpose-built database engines including relational, key-value, document, in-memory, graph, time series, and ledger databases. By picking the best database to solve a specific problem (or a group of problems), you can break away from restrictive one-size-fits-all monolithic databases and focus on building applications to meet the performance needs of your customers.In AWS you can choose from multiple purpose-built database engines including relational, key-value, document, in-memory, graph, time series, and ledger databases. With AWS databases, you don\u2019t need to worry about database management tasks such as server provisioning, patching, setup, configuration, backups, or recovery. AWS continuously monitors your clusters to keep your workloads up and running with self-healing storage and automated scaling, so that you can focus on higher value application development.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.Your workload's database approach has a significant impact on performance efficiency. It's often an area that is chosen according to organizational defaults rather than through a data-driven approach. As with storage, it is critical to consider the access patterns of your workload, and also to consider if other non-database solutions could solve the problem more efficiently (such as using graph, time series, or in-memory storage database).PERF 4: How do you select your database solution?The optimal database solution for a system varies based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability. Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.\n* The optimal database solution for a system varies based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability. Many systems use different database solutions for various subsystems and enable different features to improve performance. Selecting the wrong database solution and features for a system can lead to lower performance efficiency.Best practices\n* Use the access patterns of the workload to decide which services and technologies to use. In addition to non-functional requirements such as performance and scale, access patterns heavily influence the choice of the database and storage solutions. The first dimension is the need for transactions, ACID compliance, and consistent reads. Not every database supports these and most of the NoSQL databases provide an eventual consistency model. The second important dimension would be the distribution of write and reads over time and space. Globally distributed applications need to consider the traffic patterns, latency and access requirements in order to identify the optimal storage solution. The third crucial aspect to choose is the query pattern flexibility, random access patterns, and one-time queries. Considerations around highly specialized query functionality for text and natural language processing, time series, and graphs must also be taken into account.Desired outcome: The data storage has been selected based on identified and documented data access patterns.

This includes using application level and managed services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost. Use serverless and containers for compute, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)for static websites, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Minimize license costs by using open source software, or software that does not have license fees: for example, Amazon Linux for compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowYou can use serverless or application-level services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES. These services remove the need for you to manage a resource, and provide the function of code execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.For more information on Serverless, refer to the Well-Architected Serverless Application Lens whitepaper.Implementation stepsSelect each service to optimize cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis, select each option that provides the best match with your organizational priorities.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Using the appropriate instances and resources for your workload is key to cost savings. For example, a reporting process might take five hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over time.A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to reduce costs. For example, rather than maintaining servers to deliver email, you can use a service that charges on a per-message basis.AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs. On-DemandInstances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer savings of up to 75% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. With Spot Instances, you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and offer savings of up to 90% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are appropriate where the system can tolerate using a \ufb02eet of servers where individual servers can come and go dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or when using HPC and big data.Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs; such as CloudFront to minimize data transfer, or completely eliminate costs, such as utilizing Amazon Aurora on RDS to remove expensive database licensing costs.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.By factoring in cost during service selection, and using tools such as Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to regularly review your AWS usage, you can actively monitor your utilization and adjust your deployments accordingly.COST 5: How do you evaluate cost when you select services?Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.COST 6: How do you meet cost targets when you select resource type, size and number?Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.COST 7: How do you use pricing models to reduce cost?Use the pricing model that is most appropriate for your resources to minimize expense.COST 8: How do you plan for data transfer charges?Ensure that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make architectural decisions to minimize costs. A small yet effective architectural change can drastically reduce your operational costs over time.\n* As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective. As your requirements change, be aggressive in decommissioning resources, entire services, and systems that you no longer require.Implementing new features or resource types can optimize your workload incrementally, while minimizing the effort required to implement the change. This provides continual improvements in efficiency over time and ensures you remain on the most updated technology to reduce operating costs. You can also replace or add new components to the workload with new services. This can provide significant increases in efficiency, so it's essential to regularly review your workload, and implement new services and features.The following question focuses on these considerations for cost optimization.When regularly reviewing your deployments, assess how newer services can help save you money. For example, Amazon Aurora on RDS can reduce costs for relational databases. Using serverless such as Lambda can remove the need to operate and manage instances to run code.COST 10: How do you evaluate new services?As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective.\n\nKnowledge Area: Determining cost-effective AWS database services with appropriate use cases (for example, DynamoDB compared with Amazon RDS, serverless)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which of the following services is the most cost effective for running a disaster recovery plan on AWS?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Amazon EC2\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon EC2 is a building block service, which may not be the most cost effective for running a disaster recovery plan on AWS\"}, {\"answer\": \"Amazon S3\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon S3 is a storage service, which may not be the most cost effective for running a disaster recovery plan on AWS\"}, {\"answer\": \"AWS Lambda\", \"is_correct\": \"true\", \"explanation\": \"AWS Lambda is a serverless service, which can be cost effective for running a disaster recovery plan on AWS\"}, {\"answer\": \"Amazon EBS\", \"is_correct\": \"false\", \"explanation\": \"Amazon EBS is a block storage service, which may not be the most cost effective for running a disaster recovery plan on AWS\"}]}", "docs": ["('COST05-BP05 Select components of this workload to optimize cost in line with organization priorities - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_select_service_select_for_cost.html')", "('COST 5\\xa0 How do you evaluate cost when you select services? - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-05.html')", "('Cost-effective resources - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cereso.html')", "('Optimize over time - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-opti.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A social media platform wants to use AWS to store and process user-generated content.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 3: Design cost-optimized database solutions", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Determining cost-effective AWS database types (for example, time series format, columnar format)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

It eliminates the manual processes and time associated with provisioning on-premises infrastructure, including identifying hardware specifications, negotiating price quotations, managing purchase orders, scheduling shipments, and then deploying the resources. However, the ease of use and virtually unlimited on-demand capacity requires a new way of thinking about expenditures.Many businesses are composed of multiple systems run by various teams. The capability to attribute resource costs to the individual organization or product owners drives efficient usage behavior and helps reduce waste. Accurate cost attribution allows you to know which products are truly profitable, and allows you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate budget.In AWS, you create an account structure with AWS Organizations or AWS Control Tower, which provides separation and assists in allocation of your costs and usage. You can also use resource tagging to apply business and organization information to your usage and cost. Use AWS Cost Explorer for visibility into your cost and usage, or create customized dashboards and analytics with Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight. Controlling your cost and usage is done by notifications through AWS Budgets, and controls using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Service Quotas.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.You can use cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS usage and costs. When you apply tags to your AWS resources (such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets), AWS generates a cost and usage report with your usage and your tags. You can apply tags that represent organization categories (such as cost centers, workload names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.Ensure you use the right level of detail and granularity in cost and usage reporting and monitoring. For high level insights and trends, use daily granularity with AWS Cost Explorer. For deeper analysis and inspection use hourly granularity in AWS Cost Explorer, or Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight with the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) at an hourly granularity.Combining tagged resources with entity lifecycle tracking (employees, projects) makes it possible to identify orphaned resources or projects that are no longer generating value to the organization and should be decommissioned. You can set up billing alerts to notify you of predicted overspending.COST 2: How do you govern usage?Establish policies and mechanisms to ensure that appropriate costs are incurred while objectives are achieved. By employing a checks-and-balances approach, you can innovate without overspending.COST 3: How do you monitor usage and cost?Establish policies and procedures to monitor and appropriately allocate your costs. This allows you to measure and improve the cost efficiency of this workload.COST 4: How do you decommission resources?Implement change control and resource management from project inception to end-of-life. This ensures you shut down or terminate unused resources to reduce waste.\n* Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.Best practices\n* Configure AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets inline with your organization policies.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighTo modify usage and adjust costs, each person in your organization must have access to their cost and usage information. It is recommended that all workloads and teams have the following tooling configured when they use the cloud:Reports: Summarize of all cost and usage informationNotifications: Provide notifications when cost or usage is outside of defined limits.Current State: Configure a dashboard showing current levels of cost and usage. The dashboard should be available in a highly visible place within the work environment (similar to an operations dashboard).Trending: Provide the capability to show the variability in cost and usage over the required period of time, with the required granularity.Forecasts: Provide the capability to show estimated future costs.Tracking: Show the current cost and usage against configured goals or targets.Analysis: Provide the capability for team members to perform custom and deep analysis down to the hourly granularity, with all possible dimensions.You can use AWS native tooling, such as AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and Amazon Athena with Amazon QuickSight to provide this capability.

Regularly review the costs with configured tools or out of the box tools, do not just look at costs and categories when you receive notifications. Monitoring and analyzing costs proactively helps to identify positive trends and allows you to promote them throughout your organization.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowIt is recommended to monitor cost and usage proactively within your organization, not just when there are exceptions or anomalies. Highly visible dashboards throughout your office or work environment ensure that key people have access to the information they need, and indicate the organization\u2019s focus on cost optimization. Visible dashboards allow you to actively promote successful outcomes and implement them throughout your organization.Create a daily or frequent routine to use AWS Cost Explorer or any other dashboard such as Amazon QuickSight to see the costs and analyze proactively. Analyze AWS service usage and costs at the AWS account-level, workload-level, or specific AWS service-level with grouping and filtering, and validate whether they are expected or not. Use the hourly- and resource-level granularity and tags to filter and identify incurring costs for the top resources. You can also build your own reports with the Cost Intelligence Dashboard, an Amazon QuickSight solution built by AWS Solutions Architects, and compare your budgets with the actual cost and usage.Implementation stepsReport on cost optimization: Set up a regular cycle to discuss and analyze the efficiency of the workload. Using the metrics established, report on the metrics achieved and the cost of achieving them. Identify and fix any negative trends, and identify positive trends to promote across your organization. Reporting should involve representatives from the application teams and owners, finance, and management.Create and enable daily granularity AWS Budgets for the cost and usage to take timely actions to prevent any potential cost overruns: AWS Budgets allow you to configure alert notifications, so you stay informed if any of your budget types fall out of your pre-configured thresholds. The best way to leverage AWS Budgets is to set your expected cost and usage as your limits, so that anything above your budgets can be considered overspend.Create AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for cost monitor: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses advanced Machine Learning technology to identify anomalous spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. It allows you to configure cost monitors that define spend segments you want to evaluate (for example, individual AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories), and lets you set when, where, and how you receive your alert notifications. For each monitor, attach multiple alert subscriptions for business owners and technology teams, including a name, a cost impact threshold, and alerting frequency (individual alerts, daily summary, weekly summary) for each subscription.Use AWS Cost Explorer or integrate your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data with Amazon QuickSight dashboards to visualize your organization\u2019s costs: AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

You can also use load balancing for offloading encryption termination to improve performance and to manage and route traffic effectively.When implementing a scale-out architecture where you want to use multiple instances for service content, you can use load balancers inside your Amazon VPC. AWS provides multiple models for your applications in the ELB service. Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies, and it is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibility to centrally manage the SSL settings of the load balancer and offload CPU intensive work from your workload.Common anti-patterns:You route all internet traffic through existing load balancers.You use generic TCP load balancing and making each compute node handle SSL encryption.Benefits of establishing this best practice: A load balancer handles the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone, or across multiple Availability Zones. Load balancers feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighUse the appropriate load balancer for your workload: Select the appropriate load balancer for your workload. If you must load balance HTTP requests, we recommend Application Load Balancer. For network and transport protocols (layer 4 \u2013 TCP, UDP) load balancing, and for extreme performance and low latency applications, we recommend Network Load Balancer. Application Load Balancers support HTTPS and Network Load Balancers support TLS encryption offloading.Enable offload of HTTPS or TLS encryption: Elastic Load Balancing includes integrated certificate management, user-authentication, and SSL/TLS decryption. It provides the flexibility to centrally manage TLS settings and offload CPU intensive workloads from your applications. Encrypt all HTTPS traffic as part of your load balancer deployment.Related documents:Amazon EBS - Optimized InstancesApplication Load BalancerEC2 Enhanced Networking on LinuxEC2 Enhanced Networking on WindowsEC2 Placement GroupsEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux InstancesNetwork Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)Related examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n* These endpoints and the routing to them must be highly available. To achieve this, use highly available DNS, content delivery networks (CDNs), API Gateway, load balancing, or reverse proxies.Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public endpoints. You might also choose to evaluate AWS Marketplace software appliances for load balancing and proxying.Consumers of the service your workload provides, whether they are end-users or other services, make requests on these service endpoints. Several AWS resources are available to enable you to provide highly available endpoints.Elastic Load Balancing provides load balancing across Availability Zones, performs Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (http/https) routing, integrates with AWS WAF, and integrates with AWS Auto Scaling to help create a self-healing infrastructure and absorb increases in traffic while releasing resources when traffic decreases.Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets\u2013and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that you can use to direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks risk shutting out legitimate traffic and lowering availability for your users. AWS Shield provides automatic protection against these attacks at no extra cost for AWS service endpoints on your workload. You can augment these features with virtual appliances from APN Partners and the AWS Marketplace to meet your needs.Common anti-patterns:Using public internet addresses on instances or containers and managing the connectivity to them via DNS.Using Internet Protocol addresses instead of domain names for locating services.Providing content (web pages, static assets, media files) to a large geographic area and not using a content delivery network.Benefits of establishing this best practice: By implementing highly available services in your workload, you know that your workload will be available to your users.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighEnsure that you have highly available connectivity for users of the workload Amazon Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) all provide highly available public facing endpoints.

For example, a reporting process might take five hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over time.A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to reduce costs. For example, rather than maintaining servers to deliver email, you can use a service that charges on a per-message basis.AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs. On-DemandInstances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer savings of up to 75% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. With Spot Instances, you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and offer savings of up to 90% o\ufb00 On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are appropriate where the system can tolerate using a \ufb02eet of servers where individual servers can come and go dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or when using HPC and big data.Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs; such as CloudFront to minimize data transfer, or completely eliminate costs, such as utilizing Amazon Aurora on RDS to remove expensive database licensing costs.The following questions focus on these considerations for cost optimization.By factoring in cost during service selection, and using tools such as Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to regularly review your AWS usage, you can actively monitor your utilization and adjust your deployments accordingly.COST 5: How do you evaluate cost when you select services?Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services, such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services. By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you to work on applications and business-related activities.COST 6: How do you meet cost targets when you select resource type, size and number?Ensure that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective type, size, and number.COST 7: How do you use pricing models to reduce cost?Use the pricing model that is most appropriate for your resources to minimize expense.COST 8: How do you plan for data transfer charges?Ensure that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make architectural decisions to minimize costs.

Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements for your hybrid workload. These numbers will drive the sizing requirements for AWS Direct Connect or your VPN endpoints.Desired outcome: When deploying a workload that will need hybrid network connectivity, you have multiple configuration options for connectivity, such as managed and non-managed VPNs or Direct Connect. Select the appropriate connection type for each workload while ensuring you have adequate bandwidth and encryption requirements between your location and the cloud.Common anti-patterns:You only evaluate VPN solutions for your network encryption requirements.You don\u2019t evaluate backup or parallel connectivity options.You use default configurations for routers, tunnels, and BGP sessions.You fail to understand or identify all workload requirements (encryption, protocol, bandwidth and traffic needs).Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and configuring appropriately sized hybrid network solutions will increase the reliability of your workload and maximize performance opportunities. By identifying workload requirements, planning ahead, and evaluating hybrid solutions you will minimize expensive physical network changes and operational overhead while increasing your time to market.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighDevelop a hybrid networking architecture based on your bandwidth requirements: Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements of your hybrid applications. Based on your bandwidth requirements, a single VPN or Direct Connect connection might not be enough, and you must architect a hybrid setup to enable traffic load balancing across multiple connections. Direct connect may be required which offers more predictable and consistent performance due to its private network connectivity. It is great for production workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the AWS environment, from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps. This gives you managed and controlled latency and provisioned bandwidth so your workload can connect easily and in a performant way to other environments. Using one of the AWS Direct Connect partners, you can have end-to-end connectivity from multiple environments, thus providing an extended network with consistent performance.The AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed VPN service for VPCs. When a VPN connection is created, AWS provides tunnels to two different VPN endpoints. With AWS Transit Gateway, you can simplify the connectivity between multiple VPCs and also connect to any VPC attached to AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection. AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale beyond the 1.25Gbps IPsec VPN throughput limit by enabling equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over multiple VPN tunnels.Level of effort for the implementation plan: There is a high level of effort to evaluate workload needs for hybrid networks and to implement hybrid networking solutions.Related documents:Network Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to latency-based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsSite-to-Site VPNBuilding a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network InfrastructureDirect ConnectClient VPNRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)AWS Global AcceleratorDirect ConnectTransit Gateway ConnectVPN SolutionsSecurity with VPN SolutionsRelated examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n* Workloads often exist in multiple environments.

For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers.A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules.Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs. Many AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, support VPC endpoints, and this technology has been generalized in AWS PrivateLink. We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely. All network traffic on AWS PrivateLink stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the internet. Connectivity can only be initiated by the consumer of the service, and not by the provider of the service. Using AWS PrivateLink for external service access allows you to create air-gapped VPCs with no internet access and helps protect your VPCs from external threat vectors. Third-party services can use AWS PrivateLink to allow their customers to connect to the services from their VPCs over private IP addresses. For VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web proxies that you create and manage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighControl network traffic in a VPC: Implement VPC best practices to control traffic.Amazon VPC securityVPC endpointsAmazon VPC security groupNetwork ACLsControl traffic at the edge: Implement edge services, such as Amazon CloudFront, to provide an additional layer of protection and other features.Amazon CloudFront use casesAWS Global AcceleratorAWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)Amazon Route 53Amazon VPC Ingress RoutingControl private network traffic: Implement services that protect your private traffic for your workload.Amazon VPC PeeringAmazon VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)Amazon VPC Transit GatewayAWS Direct ConnectAWS Site-to-Site VPNAWS Client VPNAmazon S3 Access PointsRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n\nKnowledge Area: Network routing, topology, and peering (for example, AWS Transit Gateway, VPC peering)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\":\"The retail company wants to leverage AWS to support their e-commerce platform during peak shopping seasons.

For workloads with extreme resilience requirements, carefully evaluate the options for a multi-Region architecture.\n* Any workload that has some form of network connectivity, whether it\u2019s the internet or a private network, requires multiple layers of defense to help protect from external and internal network-based threats.Best practices\n* Workloads often exist in multiple environments. These include multiple cloud environments (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations such as intra- and inter-system connectivity, public IP address management, private IP address management, and domain name resolution.Best practices\n* The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.Best practices\n* Analyze and understand how network-related decisions impact workload performance. The network is responsible for the connectivity between application components, cloud services, edge networks and on-premises data and therefor it can highly impact workload performance. In addition to workload performance, user experience is also impacted by network latency, bandwidth, protocols, location, network congestion, jitter, throughput, and routing rules.Desired outcome: Have a documented list of networking requirements from the workload including latency, packet size, routing rules, protocols, and supporting traffic patterns. Review the available networking solutions and identify which service meets your workload networking characteristics. Cloud-based networks can be quickly rebuilt, so evolving your network architecture over time is necessary to improve performance efficiency.Common anti-patterns:All traffic flows through your existing data centers.You overbuild Direct Connect sessions without understanding the actual usage requirements.You don\u2019t consider workload characteristics and encryption overhead when defining your networking solutions.You use on-premises concepts and strategies for networking solutions in the cloud.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Understanding how networking impacts workload performance will help you identify potential bottlenecks, improve user experience, increase reliability, and lower operational maintenance as the workload changes.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighIdentify important network performance metrics of your workload and capture its networking characteristics. Define and document requirements as part of a data-driven approach, using benchmarking or load testing. Use this data to identify where your network solution is constrained, and examine configuration options that could improve the workload.

For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers.A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules.Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs. Many AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, support VPC endpoints, and this technology has been generalized in AWS PrivateLink. We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely. All network traffic on AWS PrivateLink stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the internet. Connectivity can only be initiated by the consumer of the service, and not by the provider of the service. Using AWS PrivateLink for external service access allows you to create air-gapped VPCs with no internet access and helps protect your VPCs from external threat vectors. Third-party services can use AWS PrivateLink to allow their customers to connect to the services from their VPCs over private IP addresses. For VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web proxies that you create and manage.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighControl network traffic in a VPC: Implement VPC best practices to control traffic.Amazon VPC securityVPC endpointsAmazon VPC security groupNetwork ACLsControl traffic at the edge: Implement edge services, such as Amazon CloudFront, to provide an additional layer of protection and other features.Amazon CloudFront use casesAWS Global AcceleratorAWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)Amazon Route 53Amazon VPC Ingress RoutingControl private network traffic: Implement services that protect your private traffic for your workload.Amazon VPC PeeringAmazon VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)Amazon VPC Transit GatewayAWS Direct ConnectAWS Site-to-Site VPNAWS Client VPNAmazon S3 Access PointsRelated documents:AWS Firewall ManagerAmazon InspectorGetting started with AWS WAFRelated videos:AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many VPCsApplication Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS ShieldRelated examples:Lab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n\nKnowledge Area: Configuring appropriate NAT gateway types for a network (for example, a single shared NAT gateway compared with NAT gateways for each Availability Zone)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"In a scenario where more than two network address spaces need to be connected via VPC peering, AWS Direct Connect, or VPN, what is the best practice for setting up a hub-and-spoke model to manage the routing of traffic across multiple networks?\", \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"Create multiple BGP connections for each VPC to establish connectivity across multiple AWS Regions\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is an anti-pattern and will increase the complexity of the connections.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use VPC peering to connect more than two VPCs\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is an anti-pattern and will increase the complexity of the connections.\"},{\"answer\": \"Use AWS Transit Gateway to provide an easy to maintain hub-and-spoke model\",\"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Transit Gateway provides an easy to maintain hub-and-spoke model, allowing routing of traffic across your multiple networks.\"},{\"answer\": \"Connect two networks directly to each other\",\"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"This is only appropriate when there are only two networks, but it becomes untenable when there are more than two networks.\"}]}", "docs": ["('REL02-BP04 Prefer hub-and-spoke topologies over many-to-many mesh - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_planning_network_topology_prefer_hub_and_spoke.html')", "('SEC05-BP02 Control traffic at all layers - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_network_protection_layered.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A company wants to run batch processing jobs on AWS, but wants to minimize costs when the jobs are not running.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 4: Design cost-optimized network architectures", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Configuring appropriate network connections (for example, Direct Connect compared with VPN compared with internet)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements for your hybrid workload. These numbers will drive the sizing requirements for AWS Direct Connect or your VPN endpoints.Desired outcome: When deploying a workload that will need hybrid network connectivity, you have multiple configuration options for connectivity, such as managed and non-managed VPNs or Direct Connect. Select the appropriate connection type for each workload while ensuring you have adequate bandwidth and encryption requirements between your location and the cloud.Common anti-patterns:You only evaluate VPN solutions for your network encryption requirements.You don\u2019t evaluate backup or parallel connectivity options.You use default configurations for routers, tunnels, and BGP sessions.You fail to understand or identify all workload requirements (encryption, protocol, bandwidth and traffic needs).Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and configuring appropriately sized hybrid network solutions will increase the reliability of your workload and maximize performance opportunities. By identifying workload requirements, planning ahead, and evaluating hybrid solutions you will minimize expensive physical network changes and operational overhead while increasing your time to market.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighDevelop a hybrid networking architecture based on your bandwidth requirements: Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements of your hybrid applications. Based on your bandwidth requirements, a single VPN or Direct Connect connection might not be enough, and you must architect a hybrid setup to enable traffic load balancing across multiple connections. Direct connect may be required which offers more predictable and consistent performance due to its private network connectivity. It is great for production workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the AWS environment, from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps. This gives you managed and controlled latency and provisioned bandwidth so your workload can connect easily and in a performant way to other environments. Using one of the AWS Direct Connect partners, you can have end-to-end connectivity from multiple environments, thus providing an extended network with consistent performance.The AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed VPN service for VPCs. When a VPN connection is created, AWS provides tunnels to two different VPN endpoints. With AWS Transit Gateway, you can simplify the connectivity between multiple VPCs and also connect to any VPC attached to AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection. AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale beyond the 1.25Gbps IPsec VPN throughput limit by enabling equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over multiple VPN tunnels.Level of effort for the implementation plan: There is a high level of effort to evaluate workload needs for hybrid networks and to implement hybrid networking solutions.Related documents:Network Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to latency-based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsSite-to-Site VPNBuilding a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network InfrastructureDirect ConnectClient VPNRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)AWS Global AcceleratorDirect ConnectTransit Gateway ConnectVPN SolutionsSecurity with VPN SolutionsRelated examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n\nKnowledge Area: Configuring appropriate network connections (for example, Direct Connect compared with VPN compared with internet)\n\nJSON Format:\n{\"question\": \"\",\"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"},{\"answer\": \"\",\"is_correct\": \"\",\"explanation\": \"\"}]}\n", "question": "{\"question\": \"Which network connection type should be used for a workload that requires consistent latency and almost zero jitter?\",\n \"answer_choices\": [{\"answer\": \"AWS Site-to-Site VPN\", \"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Site-to-Site VPN provides managed VPN service for VPCs and is not suitable for workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Direct Connect\", \"is_correct\": \"true\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the AWS environment and is suitable for production workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Client VPN\", \"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Client VPN is used for client applications for secure client connectivity and is not suitable for workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.\"},{\"answer\": \"AWS Transit Gateway\", \"is_correct\": \"false\",\"explanation\": \"AWS Transit Gateway is used for simplifying connectivity between multiple VPCs and is not suitable for workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.\"}]}", "docs": ["('PERF05-BP03 Choose appropriately sized dedicated connectivity or VPN for hybrid workloads - AWS Well-Architected Framework', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf_select_network_hybrid.html')"]}, {"scenario": "A transportation company wants to use AWS to process real-time data from connected vehicles to optimize their operations.", "domain": "Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures", "task": "Task Statement 4: Design cost-optimized network architectures", "focus": "Skills in", "item": "Configuring appropriate network routes to minimize network transfer costs (for example, Region to Region, Availability Zone to Availability Zone, private to public, Global Accelerator, VPC endpoints)", "prompt": "Generate a scenario-based multiple-choice question for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam using the provided scenario, context, and knowledge area.

Use AWS Regions, Availability Zones, placement groups, and edge locations such as AWS Outposts, AWS Local Zones, and AWS Wavelength, to reduce network latency or improve throughput.The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones. A Region is a physical location in the world having multiple Availability Zones.Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data centerChoose the appropriate Region or Regions for your deployment based on the following key elements:Where your users are located: Choosing a Region close to your workload\u2019s users ensures lower latency when they use the workload.Where your data is located: For data-heavy applications, the major bottleneck in latency is data transfer. Application code should execute as close to the data as possible.Other constraints: Consider constraints such as security and compliance.Amazon EC2 provides placement groups for networking. A placement group is a logical grouping of instances to decrease latency or increase reliability. Using placement groups with supported instance types and an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) enables workloads to participate in a low-latency, 25 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for workloads that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. Using placement groups has the benefit of lowering jitter in network communications.Latency-sensitive services are delivered at the edge using a global network of edge locations. These edge locations commonly provide services such as content delivery network (CDN) and domain name system (DNS). By having these services at the edge, workloads can respond with low latency to requests for content or DNS resolution. These services also provide geographic services such as geo targeting of content (providing different content based on the end users\u2019 location), or latency-based routing to direct end users to the nearest Region (minimum latency).Amazon CloudFront is a global CDN that can be used to accelerate both static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content such as APIs or web applications. It relies on a global network of edge locations that will cache the content and provide high-performance network connectivity to your users. CloudFront also accelerates many other features such as content uploading and dynamic applications, making it a performance addition to all applications serving traffic over the internet. Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that will let you run code closer to users of your workload, which improves performance and reduces latency.Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service. It\u2019s designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to internet applications by translating names, like www.example.com, into numeric IP addresses, like 192.168.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6.AWS Outposts is designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency requirements, where you want that workload to run seamlessly with the rest of your other workloads in AWS. AWS Outposts are fully managed and configurable compute and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware that allow you to run compute and storage on-premises, while seamlessly connecting to the broad array of AWS services in in the cloud.AWS Local Zones is designed to run workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency, like video rendering and graphics intensive, virtual desktop applications. Local Zones allow you to gain all the benefits of having compute and storage resources closer to end-users.AWS Wavelength is designed to deliver ultra-low latency applications to 5G devices by extending AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to 5G networks. Wavelength embeds storage and compute inside telco providers 5G networks to help your 5G workload if it requires single-digit millisecond latency, such as IoT devices, game streaming, autonomous vehicles, and live media production.Use edge services to reduce latency and to enable content caching. Ensure that you have configured cache control correctly for both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS to gain the most benefit from these approaches.Common anti-patterns:You consolidate all workload resources into one geographic location.You chose the closest region to your location but not to the workload end user.Benefits of establishing this best practice: You must ensure that your network is available wherever you want to reach customers. Using the AWS private global network ensures that your customers get the lowest latency experience by deploying workloads into the locations nearest them.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumReduce latency by selecting the correct locations: Identify where your users and data are located.

For example, using a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end users, caching layers using Amazon ElastiCache, or using AWS Direct Connect instead of VPN for connectivity to AWS.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world, which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront, you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content to large numbers of users globally, with minimum latency.AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.AWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and private connection between your private network and the AWS global network. It is ideal for small offices or business partners because it provides quick and easy connectivity, and it is a fully managed and elastic service.VPC Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS services over private networking and can be used to reduce public data transfer and NAT gateways costs. Gateway VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and support Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. Interface VPC endpoints are provided by AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per GB usage cost.Implementation stepsImplement services: Using the data transfer modeling, look at where the largest costs and highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess whether there is a service that reduces or removes the transfer, specifically networking and content delivery. Also look for caching services where there is repeated access to data, or large amounts of data.Related documents:AWS Direct ConnectAWS Explore Our ProductsAWS caching solutionsAmazon CloudFrontDeliver content faster with Amazon CloudFront\n* Analyze network access patterns to identify where your customers are connecting from geographically. Select Regions and services that reduce the distance network traffic must travel to decrease the total network resources required to support your workload.Common anti-patterns:You select the workload's Region based on your own location.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Placing a workload close to its customers provides the lowest latency while decreasing data movement across the network and lowering environmental impact.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumSelect the Regions for your workload deployment based on the following key elements:Your Sustainability goal: as explained in Region selection.Where your data is located: For data-heavy applications (such as big data and machine learning), application code should execute as close to the data as possible.Where your users are located: For user-facing applications, choose a Region close to your workload\u2019s customer base.Other constraints: Consider constraints such as security and compliance as explained in What to Consider when Selecting a Region for your Workloads.Use AWS Local Zones to run workloads like video rendering and graphics-intensive virtual desktop applications.

Some services or features are more cost effective at different usage levels. By performing the analysis on each component over time and at projected usage, the workload remains cost-effective over its lifetime.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowAs AWS releases new services and features, the optimal services for your workload may change. Effort required should reflect potential benefits. Workload review frequency depends on your organization requirements. If it is a workload of significant cost, implementing new services sooner will maximize cost savings, so more frequent review can be advantageous. Another trigger for review is change in usage patterns. Significant changes in usage can indicate that alternate services would be more optimal. For example, for higher data transfer rates a direct connect service may be cheaper than a VPN, and provide the required connectivity. Predict the potential impact of service changes, so you can monitor for these usage level triggers and implement the most cost-effective services sooner.Implementation stepsDefine predicted usage patterns: Working with your organization, such as marketing and product owners, document what the expected and predicted usage patterns will be for the workload.Perform cost analysis at predicted usage: Using the usage patterns defined, perform the analysis at each of these points. The analysis effort should reflect the potential outcome. For example, if the change in usage is large, a thorough analysis should be performed to verify any costs and changes.Related documents:AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) CalculatorAmazon S3 storage classesCloud products\n* Existing workloads are regularly reviewed based on for each defined processes.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowTo realize the benefits of new AWS services and features, you must execute the review process on your workloads and implement new services and features as required. For example, you might review your workloads and replace the messaging component with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES). This removes the cost of operating and maintaining a fleet of instances, while providing all the functionality at a reduced cost.Implementation stepsRegularly review the workload: Using your defined process, perform reviews with the frequency specified. Verify that you spend the correct amount of effort on each component. This process would be similar to the initial design process where you selected services for cost optimization. Analyze the services and the benefits they would bring, this time factor in the cost of making the change, not just the long-term benefits.Implement new services: If the outcome of the analysis is to implement changes, first perform a baseline of the workload to know the current cost for each output. Implement the changes, then perform an analysis to confirm the new cost for each output.Related documents:AWS News BlogTypes of Cloud ComputingWhat's New with AWS\n* Analyze and understand how network-related decisions impact workload performance. The network is responsible for the connectivity between application components, cloud services, edge networks and on-premises data and therefor it can highly impact workload performance. In addition to workload performance, user experience is also impacted by network latency, bandwidth, protocols, location, network congestion, jitter, throughput, and routing rules.Desired outcome: Have a documented list of networking requirements from the workload including latency, packet size, routing rules, protocols, and supporting traffic patterns. Review the available networking solutions and identify which service meets your workload networking characteristics. Cloud-based networks can be quickly rebuilt, so evolving your network architecture over time is necessary to improve performance efficiency.Common anti-patterns:All traffic flows through your existing data centers.You overbuild Direct Connect sessions without understanding the actual usage requirements.You don\u2019t consider workload characteristics and encryption overhead when defining your networking solutions.You use on-premises concepts and strategies for networking solutions in the cloud.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Understanding how networking impacts workload performance will help you identify potential bottlenecks, improve user experience, increase reliability, and lower operational maintenance as the workload changes.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighIdentify important network performance metrics of your workload and capture its networking characteristics. Define and document requirements as part of a data-driven approach, using benchmarking or load testing. Use this data to identify where your network solution is constrained, and examine configuration options that could improve the workload.

Implement throttling when your clients perform retries. Implement buffering to store the request and defer processing until a later time. Verify that your throttles and buffers are designed so clients receive a response in the required time.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowThrottling: If the source of the demand has retry capability, then you can implement throttling. Throttling tells the source that if it cannot service the request at the current time it should try again later. The source will wait for a period of time and then re-try the request. Implementing throttling has the advantage of limiting the maximum amount of resources and costs of the workload. In AWS, you can use Amazon API Gateway to implement throttling. Refer to the Well-Architected Reliability pillar whitepaper for more details on implementing throttling.Buffer based: Similar to throttling, a buffer defers request processing, allowing applications that run at different rates to communicate effectively. A buffer-based approach uses a queue to accept messages (units of work) from producers. Messages are read by consumers and processed, allowing the messages to run at the rate that meets the consumers\u2019 business requirements. You don\u2019t have to worry about producers having to deal with throttling issues, such as data durability and backpressure (where producers slow down because their consumer is running slowly).In AWS, you can choose from multiple services to implement a buffering approach. Amazon Simple Queue Service(Amazon SQS) is a managed service that provides queues that allow a single consumer to read individual messages. Amazon Kinesis provides a stream that allows many consumers to read the same messages.When architecting with a buffer-based approach, ensure that you architect your workload to service the request in the required time, and that you are able to handle duplicate requests for work.Implementation stepsAnalyze the client requirements: Analyze the client requests to determine if they are capable of performing retries. For clients that cannot perform retries, buffers will need to be implemented. Analyze the overall demand, rate of change, and required response time to determine the size of throttle or buffer required.Implement a buffer or throttle: Implement a buffer or throttle in the workload. A queue such as Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) can provide a buffer to your workload components. Amazon API Gateway can provide throttling for your workload components.Related documents:AWS Auto ScalingAWS Instance SchedulerAmazon API GatewayAmazon Simple Queue ServiceGetting started with Amazon SQSAmazon Kinesis\n* Throttling requests is a mitigation pattern to respond to an unexpected increase in demand. Some requests are honored but those over a defined limit are rejected and return a message indicating they have been throttled. The expectation on clients is that they will back off and abandon the request or try again at a slower rate.Your services should be designed to handle a known capacity of requests that each node or cell can process. This capacity can be established through load testing. You then need to track the arrival rate of requests and if the temporary arrival rate exceeds this limit, the appropriate response is to signal that the request has been throttled. This allows the user to retry, potentially to a different node or cell that might have available capacity. Amazon API Gateway provides methods for throttling requests. Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis can buffer requests, smooth out the request rate, and alleviate the need for throttling for requests that can be addressed asynchronously.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighThrottle requests. This is a mitigation pattern to respond to an unexpected increase in demand. Some requests are honored but those over a defined limit are rejected and return a message indicating they have been throttled. The expectation on clients is that they will back off and abandon the request or try again at a slower rate.Use Amazon API GatewayThrottle API Requests for Better ThroughputRelated documents:Amazon API Gateway: Throttle API Requests for Better ThroughputError Retries and Exponential Backoff in AWSThe Amazon Builders' Library: Avoiding fallback in distributed systemsThe Amazon Builders' Library: Avoiding insurmountable queue backlogsThe Amazon Builders' Library: Timeouts, retries, and backoff with jitterThrottle API Requests for Better ThroughputRelated videos:Retry, backoff, and jitter: AWS re:Invent 2019: Introducing The Amazon Builders\u2019 Library (DOP328)\n* Where applicable, use multiple strategies to improve performance. For example, using strategies like caching data to prevent excessive network or database calls, using read-replicas for database engines to improve read rates, sharding or compressing data where possible to reduce data volumes, and buffering and streaming of results as they are available to avoid blocking.As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes. Measure the impacts to the system and to the end-user to understand how your trade-offs impact your workload. Use a systematic approach, such as load testing, to explore whether the tradeoff improves performance.Common anti-patterns:You assume that workload performance is adequate if customers are not complaining.You only collect data on performance after you have made performance-related changes.Benefits of establishing this best practice: To optimize performance and resource utilization, you need a unified operational view, real-time granular data, and historical reference. You can create dashboards and perform metric math on your data to derive operational and utilization insights for your workloads as they change over time.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: LowUse a data-driven approach to evolve your architecture: As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics to determine the impact of those changes.

Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements for your hybrid workload. These numbers will drive the sizing requirements for AWS Direct Connect or your VPN endpoints.Desired outcome: When deploying a workload that will need hybrid network connectivity, you have multiple configuration options for connectivity, such as managed and non-managed VPNs or Direct Connect. Select the appropriate connection type for each workload while ensuring you have adequate bandwidth and encryption requirements between your location and the cloud.Common anti-patterns:You only evaluate VPN solutions for your network encryption requirements.You don\u2019t evaluate backup or parallel connectivity options.You use default configurations for routers, tunnels, and BGP sessions.You fail to understand or identify all workload requirements (encryption, protocol, bandwidth and traffic needs).Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting and configuring appropriately sized hybrid network solutions will increase the reliability of your workload and maximize performance opportunities. By identifying workload requirements, planning ahead, and evaluating hybrid solutions you will minimize expensive physical network changes and operational overhead while increasing your time to market.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: HighDevelop a hybrid networking architecture based on your bandwidth requirements: Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements of your hybrid applications. Based on your bandwidth requirements, a single VPN or Direct Connect connection might not be enough, and you must architect a hybrid setup to enable traffic load balancing across multiple connections. Direct connect may be required which offers more predictable and consistent performance due to its private network connectivity. It is great for production workloads that require consistent latency and almost zero jitter.AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the AWS environment, from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps. This gives you managed and controlled latency and provisioned bandwidth so your workload can connect easily and in a performant way to other environments. Using one of the AWS Direct Connect partners, you can have end-to-end connectivity from multiple environments, thus providing an extended network with consistent performance.The AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed VPN service for VPCs. When a VPN connection is created, AWS provides tunnels to two different VPN endpoints. With AWS Transit Gateway, you can simplify the connectivity between multiple VPCs and also connect to any VPC attached to AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection. AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale beyond the 1.25Gbps IPsec VPN throughput limit by enabling equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over multiple VPN tunnels.Level of effort for the implementation plan: There is a high level of effort to evaluate workload needs for hybrid networks and to implement hybrid networking solutions.Related documents:Network Load BalancerNetworking Products with AWSTransit GatewayTransitioning to latency-based Routing in Amazon Route 53VPC EndpointsVPC Flow LogsSite-to-Site VPNBuilding a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network InfrastructureDirect ConnectClient VPNRelated videos:Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures (NET317-R1)Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances (CMP308-R1)AWS Global AcceleratorDirect ConnectTransit Gateway ConnectVPN SolutionsSecurity with VPN SolutionsRelated examples:AWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security SolutionsAWS Networking Workshops\n* The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement.Best practices\n* Make decisions about protocols for communication between systems and networks based on the impact to the workload\u2019s performance.There is a relationship between latency and bandwidth to achieve throughput. If your file transfer is using TCP, higher latencies will reduce overall throughput. There are approaches to fix this with TCP tuning and optimized transfer protocols, some approaches use UDP.Common anti-patterns:You use TCP for all workloads regardless of performance requirements.Benefits of establishing this best practice: Selecting the proper protocol for communication between workload components ensures that you are getting the best performance for that workload. Connection-less UDP allows for high speed, but it doesn't offer retransmission or high reliability. TCP is a full featured protocol, but it requires greater overhead for processing the packets.Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: MediumOptimize network traffic: Select the appropriate protocol to optimize the performance of your workload. There is a relationship between latency and bandwidth to achieve throughput. If your file transfer is using TCP, higher latencies reduce overall throughput.

There are also workloads that are heavily dependent on network performance such as High Performance Computing (HPC) where deep network understanding is important to increase cluster performance. You must determine the workload requirements for bandwidth, latency, jitter, and throughput.On AWS, networking is virtualized and is available in a number of different types and configurations. This makes it easier to match your networking methods with your needs. AWS offers product features (for example, Enhanced Networking, Amazon EBS-optimized instances, Amazon S3 transfer acceleration, and dynamic Amazon CloudFront) to optimize network traffic. AWS also offers networking features (for example, Amazon Route 53 latency routing, Amazon VPC endpoints, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS Global Accelerator) to reduce network distance or jitter.The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency.You must consider location when deploying your network. You can choose to place resources close to where they will be used to reduce distance. Use networking metrics to make changes to networking configuration as the workload evolves. By taking advantage of Regions, placement groups, and edge services, you can significantly improve performance. Cloud based networks can be quickly re-built or modified, so evolving your network architecture over time is necessary to maintain performance efficiency.PERF 5: How do you configure your networking solution?The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth.
